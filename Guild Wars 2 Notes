Guild Wars 2 Notes
General
Good combat, mixture of action and tab targeting.
Has stamina + dodging, no active blocking. Most abilities are ground targeted or enemy targeted w/ tab targeting.
No trinity, but the most efficient way to play for endgame stuff is with pseudo trinity anyway (tank / kiter, healer, DPS, support = buff & healer / DPS hybrid).
Quickness + Alacrity buffs shape the meta. Do not like these buffs as it feels awful not to have them, whereas no Might (+Damage) or Fury (+Crit chance) don’t feel nearly as bad when you don’t have them.
Wiki integration is great, and would be perfect if there was an in-game client rather than having to open it in a browser.
Again, spoilt by FFXIV with having all classes on 1 character, really miss that since I end up creating either 1 character but cloning it for other classes (GW2), using almost default presets for the non main classes (BDO) or just not having more than 1 class (WoW).
Feels like this is just so they can get you to pay for character slots.
Can’t have every crafting profession on the same character, forced to have multiple characters for that.
There is sort of a shared levelling system post level 80, but they’re for utilities rather than combat stuff (auto-loot which should’ve been basekit, crafting, mount skills, etc).
Awful microtransactions, lots of FOMO. Should strictly be for cosmetics and not convenience. Even more insulting is that equipment & skill loadouts are both separate and character bound, so if you play more than 1 character it’s absolutely overpriced.
Loot. Boxes.
Being able to buy currency in exchange for in-game currency is bad. The effects aren’t too awful as the game has horizontal progression that’s somewhat easy to reach the highest level but still, being able to buy progression (via gear, materials, etc) is dumb.
People often laud the fact that it’s horizontal progression and they feel like they don’t need to grind anything on a gear cycle, but end up permanently grinding for gold to achieve anything. Sometimes I feel bad that I’m not grinding the most profitable content for gold.
That being said, there are a lot of open world events that are both profitable and fun. It’s just when it becomes a grind that sucks out the enjoyment of it.
Little instanced content that I feel like I could quickly jump into, both because there’s very few and the party finder is absolute trash.
Global trading post is great, except when the gold barons are able to manipulate it.
Inventory management is annoying, junk being dropped by everything taking up space and since you have to pay for gear sets your gear will be sitting in the inventory too. Also filled with random items that have very specific uses like teleporters & keys, etc.
Way too many currencies & keys & materials.
Imagine paying 500g to unlock basic party leadership functionality.
Mounts are great, but some are redundant (Springer vs. Skyscale, Skimmer vs. Skiff).
UI needs more customisation, currently only size & where minimap is.
Buff bar is awful, a tiny row of icons that doesn’t seem to have any priority. This excludes boons (positive buffs) and conditions (negative buffs) which are common across all classes; these have their own row.
Skill tooltips are nice and detailed, they also have easy to understand icons.
Infusion stacking is the worst visual design I’ve seen in my life in a game. Not being able to turn it off / hide those players is just as awful.
There is so much visual clutter when doing large meta events. This is allegedly being fixed in June w/ a filter, 10+ years after launch.
Way too much RNG in everything: loot boxes, random skin unlocks, microtransactions (can’t even choose what skin you want for mounts most of the time), gear, mob drops, even enemy prefix augments like in PoE (ones that require you to stay melee / ranged on a boss that teleports randomly, great design), etc.
Balance split between PvE & PvP took years but eventually happened, meaning some skills that are useless are now less useless in their respective modes (separate numbers, slightly different effects, etc).
There is underwater combat with its own set of weapons & abilities, but it’s not that great. Not awful but not really part of the game at all, so won’t include it here at all.
There’s also a couple of skills when you’re downed / drowning (downed underwater). Won’t be including those either as they’re mostly damage / helping you survive long enough to get saved.
Elementalist
Elementalist Combat
Love the concept, execution could be better.
Swap between 4 elements: fire, water, air & earth.
Fire is designed to have heavy damage & burning (DoT).
Water is designed to have support (utility) & healing.
Air is designed to have heavy damage & CC.
Earth is designed to have DoTs & defense.
Each element has its own set of weapon skills.
Utility skills are the same but some change depending on current element (glyph).
In exchange for 4 elements, Ele’s cannot swap weapons in combat.
Most of the time, the best way to play the class is to stick to 2 elements, meaning half the kit is ignored.
This coupled with the fact that it was originally designed to have more but slightly less impactful / specific skills makes it feel bad to ignore half the kit.
The only builds that go through all elements are Weaver (with Weave Self) and hammer Catalyst (with Grand Finale).
The fact that you can’t swap weapons in combat means that you’re sometimes useless when forced to be ranged if you’re using a melee weapon. This can be countered with fight knowledge / using ranged weapons / Conjures / sitting on your thumb.
Absolutely hate that Ele has very little HP and very little armour; they effectively have half the effective health of Warrior.
This is meant to be balanced by the fact that Ele has more active defense (shields, immunities) but they’ve all been nerfed / changed leaving a wet piece of tissue paper.
Understand that PvP is balanced around this, no reason for this to be the case in PvE.
Conjures are awful. Imagine having to pick up (F) a weapon. Completely replaces your weapon bar and (for DPS purposes) you’re encouraged to use the biggest damaging abilities then drop it. Damage is totally gimped if some random person takes your other weapon or it despawns because you have to go through a dumb pick up animation.



Elementalist Abilities
Staff

Staff Fire 1 - Fireball

Targeted projectile AoE for damage & 1s burning (only PvE, will only be doing PvE version).

All “1” abilities are the auto-attack so they’re going to be somewhat basic. Fits with the main theme of Fire which is direct damage and DoTs. Feels clunky with the cast time & it being a targeted skill in a mostly action combat game.

Staff Fire 2 - Lava Font

Staff Fire 3 - Flame Burst

Staff Fire 4 - Burning Retreat

Staff Fire 5 - Meteor Shower

Staff Water 1 - Water Blast

Staff Water 2 - Ice Spike

Staff Water 3 - Geyser

Staff Water 4 - Frozen Ground

Staff Water 5 - Healing Rain

Staff Air 1 - Chain Lightning

Staff Air 2 - Lightning Surge

Staff Air 3 - Gust

Staff Air 4 - Windborne Speed

Staff Air 5 - Static Field

Staff Earth 1 - Stoning

Staff Earth 2 - Eruption


Staff Earth 3 - Magnetic Aura & Transmute Earth

Staff Earth 4 - Unsteady Ground

Staff Earth 5 - Shock Wave
