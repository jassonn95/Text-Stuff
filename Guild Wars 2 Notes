Guild Wars 2 Notes
General
Good combat, mixture of action and tab targeting.
Targeting sometimes gets annoying when mobs surround / get behind you. Skills won’t fire until you manually face them which is fine for the action combat skills, very annoying for the enemy targeted ones. Something like FFXIV’s legacy camera movement would work wonders and make the targeting feel less clunky.
Has stamina + dodging, no active blocking. Most abilities are ground targeted or enemy targeted w/ tab targeting.
No trinity, but the most efficient way to play for endgame stuff is with pseudo trinity anyway (tank / kiter, healer, DPS, support = buff & healer / DPS hybrid).
Quickness + Alacrity buffs shape the meta. Do not like these buffs as it feels awful not to have them, whereas no Might (+Damage) or Fury (+Crit chance) don’t feel nearly as bad when you don’t have them.
Wiki integration is great, and would be perfect if there was an in-game client rather than having to open it in a browser.
Again, spoilt by FFXIV with having all classes on 1 character, really miss that since I end up creating either 1 character but cloning it for other classes (GW2), using almost default presets for the non main classes (BDO) or just not having more than 1 class (WoW).
Feels like this is just so they can get you to pay for character slots.
Can’t have every crafting profession on the same character, forced to have multiple characters for that.
There is sort of a shared levelling system post level 80, but they’re for utilities rather than combat stuff (auto-loot which should’ve been basekit, special crafting, mount skills, etc).
Awful microtransactions, lots of FOMO. Should strictly be for cosmetics and not convenience. Even more insulting is that equipment & skill loadouts are both separate and character bound, so if you play more than 1 character it’s absolutely overpriced.
Loot. Boxes.
Being able to buy currency in exchange for in-game currency is bad. The effects aren’t too awful as the game has horizontal progression that’s somewhat easy to reach the highest level but still, being able to buy progression (via gear, materials, etc) is dumb.
People often laud the fact that it’s horizontal progression and they feel like they don’t need to grind anything on a gear cycle, but end up permanently grinding for gold to achieve anything. Sometimes I feel bad that I’m not grinding the most profitable content for gold.
That being said, there are a lot of open world events that are both profitable and fun. It’s just when it becomes a grind that sucks out the enjoyment of it.
Little instanced content that I feel like I could quickly jump into, both because there’s very few and the party finder is absolute trash.
Global trading post is great, except when the gold barons are able to manipulate it.
Inventory management is annoying, junk being dropped by everything taking up space and since you have to pay for gear sets your gear will be sitting in the inventory too. Also filled with random items that have very specific uses like teleporters & keys, etc.
Way too many currencies & keys & materials.
Imagine paying 500g to unlock basic party leadership functionality.
Mounts are great, but some are redundant (Springer vs. Skyscale, Skimmer vs. Skiff).
UI needs more customisation, currently only size & where minimap is.
Buff bar is awful, a tiny row of icons that doesn’t seem to have any priority. This excludes boons (positive buffs) and conditions (negative buffs) which are common across all classes; these have their own row.
Skill tooltips are nice and detailed, they also have easy to understand icons.
Infusion stacking is the worst visual design I’ve seen in my life in a game. Not being able to turn it off / hide those players is just as awful.
There is so much visual clutter when doing large meta events. This is allegedly being fixed in June w/ a filter, 10+ years after launch.
Way too much RNG in everything: loot boxes, random skin unlocks, microtransactions (can’t even choose what skin you want for mounts most of the time), gear, mob drops, even enemy prefix augments like in PoE (ones that require you to stay melee / ranged on a boss that teleports randomly, great design), etc.
Balance split between PvE & PvP took years but eventually happened, meaning some skills that are useless are now less useless in their respective modes (separate numbers, slightly different effects, etc).
There is underwater combat with its own set of weapons & abilities, but it’s not that great. Not awful but not really part of the game at all, so won’t include it here at all.
There’s also a couple of skills when you’re downed / drowning (downed underwater). Won’t be including those either as they’re mostly damage / helping you survive long enough to get saved.
Combos are an interesting mechanic but they’ve pretty much been unchanged since release. Their importance and effectiveness have gone down while new classes, specialisations, weapons + skills have made them even more irrelevant. Why bother comboing for boons when another class can press a couple of buttons for permanent buff uptime.
Every interaction being bound to F is very annoying.
Elementalist
Elementalist Combat
Love the concept, execution could be better.
Swap between 4 elements: fire, water, air & earth.
Fire is designed to have heavy damage & burning (DoT).
Water is designed to have support (utility) & healing.
Air is designed to have heavy damage & CC.
Earth is designed to have DoTs & defense.
Each element has its own set of weapon skills.
Utility skills are the same but some change depending on current element (glyph).
In exchange for 4 elements, Ele’s cannot swap weapons in combat.
Most of the time, the best way to play the class is to stick to 2 elements, meaning half the kit is ignored.
This coupled with the fact that it was originally designed to have more but slightly less impactful / specific skills makes it feel bad to ignore half the kit.
The only builds that go through all elements are Weaver (with Weave Self) and hammer Catalyst (with Grand Finale).
The fact that you can’t swap weapons in combat means that you’re sometimes useless when forced to be ranged if you’re using a melee weapon. This can be countered with fight knowledge / using ranged weapons / Conjures / sitting on your thumb.
Absolutely hate that Ele has very little HP and very little armour; they effectively have half the effective health of Warrior.
This is meant to be balanced by the fact that Ele has more active defense (shields, immunities) but they’ve all been nerfed / changed leaving a wet piece of tissue paper.
Understand that PvP is balanced around this, no reason for this to be the case in PvE.
Conjures are awful. Imagine having to pick up (F) a weapon. Completely replaces your weapon bar and (for DPS purposes) you’re encouraged to use the biggest damaging abilities then drop it. Damage is totally gimped if some random person takes your other weapon or it despawns because you have to go through a dumb pick up animation.
Power budget includes access to a lot of combo fields. The importance of combos has changed over the years so how much of the power budget it takes up should be adjusted (there are much easier ways to get boons these days).
Auras are also meant to be a prominent feature for Eles but they haven’t really been changed since release either. They last for very little time and are unaffected by boon duration stats, so their effects while decently strong are rarely felt, especially since it requires you to get hit.
Elementalist Abilities
Staff
Long range, being pushed to be more support oriented.

Staff Fire 1 - Fireball

Targeted projectile AoE for damage & Burn (only PvE, will only be doing PvE version).

All “1” abilities are the auto-attack so they’re going to be somewhat basic. Fits with the main theme of Fire which is direct damage and DoTs. Also fits the theme of a staff being ranged and slow. Won’t be mentioning if it fits the theme for other abilities, will only mention it if it doesn’t. Feels clunky with the cast time & it being a targeted skill in a mostly action combat game. Especially annoying since your character won’t turn to face and cast if they’re behind you.

Staff Fire 2 - Lava Font

Ground targeted AoE field for damage & Burn. Fire field for combos.

Simple ground targeted AoE for damage. It’s quick and has a low cooldown so not as heavily punished if things move out of it, which it will since its size is pretty small. Combo field lasts for 4s so there’s some time to get some combos off. 

Staff Fire 3 - Flame Burst

Targeted AoE damage, Burn & Blind.

Simple AoE around the target enemy. Same annoyances about enemy targeted skills apply. Blind is also an annoying condition because of how detrimental or useless it is. It completely negates the next singular outgoing attack. This makes it either extremely effective against slower classes or borderline useless against persistent DPS / AoE classes. Should be made more standardised by either making all attacks miss for a far lower duration or make it so it forces the affected to break targeting and darken the screen. The latter may be annoying as CC affecting the player (as in the person playing) isn’t that great by design; it’s annoying, frustrating and could be worked around by putting gamma up to a 100 or something. Blindness has the same issue as the old dodge stats from LoL, WoW and FFXIV where it’s frustrating when it happens and is a minor inconvenience to get rid of (reaching X accuracy or smacking something once in GW2’s case).

Staff Fire 4 - Burning Retreat

Backflip that leaves a burning field that damages, Burn and acts as a combo field.

Active mitigation is good as it fits the squishy mage archetype Ele has going on. There is also a point to be made about risk vs. reward in using this for damage vs. using it as a dodge. But the fact that it’s kinda janky and using an escape on an enemy that’s not actively engaging you / hitting someone else feels weird. Compare this to FFXIV Red Mage, which has Displacement (backflip w/ 1 instance of damage) & Engagement (same damage as Displacement, does NOT backflip), which both share charges. There’s still risk involved in using it and running into a situation where you need to disengage, but there’s no situation where you’re running away only to walk back in range again to continue DPSing. That is a fundamental difference in combat (FFXIV having all abilities available at all times, GW2 having a CD between certain “sets”) but the point still stands.

Staff Fire 5 - Meteor Shower

Big area, long range, long cast time. Think old GP ult where each ball does damage but you could conceivably get lucky and dodge all by sheer luck. Each hit reduces the damage of the next by 10% (not multiplicative), down to a minimum of 10%.

The first 3 points are good. It should cover a large area, it should be long range (staff) and it should have a long cast time for a powerful spell, both in damage and coverage. It was pulsing damaging field with an ICD / tick rate but was changed to this monstrosity for some reason. Adding randomness to the big cooldown spell makes it feel awful to use because of how unreliable it is. Even if you do land the hits, it will be miserable to see a meteor smack someone in the face and it does like 100 damage. If it was too strong they should’ve adjusted the damage, not making it both random and sucky when it does land.

Staff Water 1 - Water Blast

Targeted projectile AoE. Enemy is damaged, allies around it get healed.

Simple as expected from a 1 skill. Fits the purpose of Water which is support. Still has the clunky targeted ranged aspect. Not useful for DPS since damage and healing are separate stats. Could have included CC or some debuff that would interact with DPS to make it less horrible to use, like Hammer (will discuss later).

Staff Water 2 - Ice Spike

The only damaging ability in Water. Delayed ground targeted nuke which debuffs enemies for more damage & blasts combo fields.

Probably the best overall ability for staff Water. It damages so it’s usable by DPS, it debuffs so it fills the support role and it blasts combos which is versatile since blasting water fields = healing, but blasting a fire field = Might boon for allies, etc.

Staff Water 3 - Geyser

Ground targeted healing AoE w/ Water combo field.

Pure support ability. Not inherently a bad thing if the overall skill set is balanced between offense and defense but that’s not the case for staff Water. It’s a small field with a big cooldown due to a talent affecting it (where it also revives) so there’s some risk in using it, not being able to revive someone because you were healing.

Staff Water 4 - Frozen Ground

Ground targeted AoE Ice combo field. Enemies Chilled and allies given Frost Aura.

Until very recently, it was just the ice field + chill, you could tell how much stock was put into combo fields. The addition of the Frost Aura is welcome but the Ice Field & Chill aren’t that useful in PvE for Ele. Auras have no base effect if you’re not hit, and Chill isn’t all that impactful other than the slow and the defiance bar (CC) depletion. Ele has no talents that affect Chill like Reaper (Necromancer) does, where they do more damage against Chilled targets.

Staff Water 5 - Healing Rain

Big AoE Water combo field. Regening, cleansing & healing per cleanse.

Big support ability on a big cooldown. Used to not have the heal on cleanse so it was just regen & cleansing + a water field; same note above about combo field value. It’s fine for all of this ability's power budget being spent on support / utility, but the fact that there’s only 1 damaging ability in Water means there’s almost no reason to get into Water as DPS. If 3 or 4 (or both) was more DPS oriented and 1 also hit in an AoE on enemies (targeting in action combat games is a bit wonky sometimes, issues hitting the correct enemy) it would be a lot better.

Staff Air 1 - Chain Lightning

Bouncing lightning attack on target. Bounces 3 times and can bounce back to 1st.

The usual bouncing lightning attack. Sort of dumb that the max single target DPS requires a 2nd target; there’s no extra line about the target taking extra damage if it doesn’t bounce.

Staff Air 2 - Lightning Surge

Targeted AoE that also blinds.

Somehow only just now realising that this is the same as Fire Staff 3, but without the burn. Same notes apply.

Staff Air 3 - Gust

Long range knockback.

Some self peel, but this feels like a PvP balanced ability that’s left there for PvE. The knockback isn’t that strong relative to other CC and that’s all it does. It’s on a big cooldown and the only thing that’s going for it is that it’s long ranged. Doesn’t necessarily need damage, but it could use another effect that goes along with the peeling or CC aspect. Honestly if this skill came out recently I could see it being straight up merged with the next one, with some minor adjustments.

Staff Air 4 - Windborne Speed

AoE movement cleanse & movespeed buffs.

Previously only had the 1 Swiftness (+33% movement speed) boon, recently added 3s of Superspeed (+100% movement speed) onto it. So there’s a quick burst of movement and then the weaker but longer boon too. Would be merged with Staff Air 3 if this was created this decade. Otherwise, can’t add Quickness to it due to the problematic nature of it and Alacrity. Those 2 boons can’t be base kit otherwise you would be able to apply both and cover 2 support roles in 1.

Staff Air 5 - Static Field

Ground targeted AoE lightning combo field. Veigar cage w/ stun on edge.

The only other damaging ability for Staff Air and it does less damage than the auto. Only reiterates the fact that 3 & 4 should be merged and another damaging ability should be added. Ability itself is small but long range and is a good zoning tool but overall means Air is almost exclusively meant for CC only. Meaning dipping out of Fire for damage is more often than not detrimental to DPS.

Staff Earth 1 - Stoning

Single target (!) combo projectile w/ Weakness (-Endurance / Stamina regen, attacks can’t crit and deal 50% damage) debuff.

There’s no reason why auto-attacks deal AoE damage in an action game. It reduces the cases of janky targeting and wouldn’t be detrimental in PvP since most people aren’t stacking right on top of each other, except in WvW but if you’re in range of that many people you’re probably gone anyway since it’s mostly zergs. It’s guaranteed to act as a projectile for combos but those effects aren’t that useful. Honestly the only useful combo are the boon ones since they actually last for a while. Weakness debuff is only half useful in PvE for the damage reduction but it’s not powerful enough to camp Earth for it.

Staff Earth 2 - Eruption

Delayed ground targeted AoE w/ Bleed, Cripple (slow) & combo blast.

A good overall skill. Delay means you can cast it & put down a field afterwards to blast it for some actual decent combo effects. There is a long cast time though which takes some getting used to since it doesn’t feel like something that would require a channel (in fact you can move during that time).


Staff Earth 3 - Magnetic Aura & Transmute Earth

Self buff w/ Magnetic Aura, reflecting all projectiles for 4s. Turns into Transmute Earth while you have a Magnetic Aura, letting you deal PBAoE damage, granting Stability (hard CC immunity stacks) to allies & blasting combos.

Magnetic Aura has a 30s cooldown for some reason, and it only affects yourself. Would be understandable if it also affected allies & gave them Protection (damage reduction) or some other effect. Right now it’s just a single aura which is somewhat insulting to be 30s and take up an ability slot (which you don’t choose). Transmute Earth was added 6 years into the game, so Magnetic Aura was infinitely worse before then. It makes the overall ability a lot less crap and provides some utility (damage is minimal). It has 3x the cooldown in PvE for some reason, as if to prevent it from being used twice since no one is going to camp Earth for > 10s. Could also have a Bleed effect to contribute to the Earth theme.

Staff Earth 4 - Unsteady Ground

Creates a line that enemies can’t cross (they’ll be knocked back).

It’s a pretty barebones ability. There’s no damage, no DoT and it barely counts as a “defensive” ability for the Earth theme (it’s the same thing as saying damage is CC since enemies can’t hurt you if they’re dead). Previously damaged and Crippled enemies that move through it. Needs an initial effect when placed like deals X damage and puts a Bleed on them or something. 30s CD too.

Staff Earth 5 - Shock Wave

Targeted combo projectile that damages, Bleeds and Immobilizes (roots) all hit (piercing up to 5).

Good skill: damages, DoTs and CCs. No real complaints other than the 25s CD, meaning you’re encouraged to dump CDs and go to the next element but that’s not too feasible since there are some real crappy skills in some of the other attunements (cough Water & Air).

Scepter
Mid-long range.

Scepter Fire 1 - Flamestrike

Targeted AoE 2 part attack. 1st is targeted, 2nd is wherever the 1st was after a brief delay. Both damage & Burn.

The usual ranged targeted attack, w/ the 2nd part delay twist. This gives it a bit of counterplay in PvP and a lot of grief in PvE if the mobs move out of it.

Scepter Fire 2 - Dragon’s Tooth

Targeted delayed AoE. Damages, Burns & blasts.

Originally targeted, then became ground casted, meaning it would miss. A lot. Being changed to targeted means more reliability = more damage & less frustration. It doing good damage & blasting combos fits the animation.

Scepter Fire 3 - Phoenix

Ground targeted piercing attack that damages & Burns before exploding for more damage & Blasting combos. It returns again doing more passthrough damage & Burn while cleansing self & providing Vigor (stamina regen).

Good overall ability, with somewhat random utility attached to it that’s normally reserved for Water. Damage requires aiming both directional and ground targeted so it’s not exactly the same as Scepter Fire 2. Utility is nice but again, would be better suited to Water or Earth even.

Scepter Water 1 - Ice Shards

Single target attack w/ 3 instances of the same damage. No other effect, but should be a chance combo projectile like Scepter Earth 1.

Bit annoying with the targeted single target attack. Otherwise somewhat boring as it has no other effects. It’s almost identical to Scepter Earth 1 but without the bleed (understandable) and without the combo projectile chance. It having 3 instances of damage makes it less likely to be screwed over by crit RNG, if it wasn’t for the fact that non-DoT builds build around having 100% crit.

Scepter Water 2 - Shatterstone

Ground targeted delayed AoE that damages & Chills.

The usual ground targeted AoE ability. Used to apply Vulnerability (increased damage taken) but was replaced with Chill, specifically for the next ability. Slight delay means there’s some counterplay but not that important in PvE. Low cooldown so can be spammed, who doesn’t love exploding ice everywhere?

Scepter Water 3 - Water Trident

Multitarget (3) attack. Damages & heals you per target hit (up to double base amount w/ 3 hits). Damage increased against Chilled targets (+50%). 2 charges.

Great ability imo. Homes in on nearby enemies so doesn’t require enemies to be on top of each other. Damage synergy with previous ability w/ Chill conditional, but not at an absurd level like 100%. Heals for some sustain without going too crazy in single target vs. AoE situations. Charge based so you’re not punished for holding onto a charge to heal, acts as another pseudo active mitigation / recovery tool that Eles need for their awful survivability. You can definitely tell this was recently revamped (was ground targeted damage enemy heal allies AoE, no charges, no Chill damage modifier).

Scepter Air 1 - Arc Lightning

Channelled multitarget beam attack. Damage is backloaded.

Encourages you to keep an eye on the attack channel for max value as the last 4 tickets deal 4x the first portion and 2x the 2nd portion. Even though it’s a beam attack it still hits more than 1 target, unlike someone else.

Scepter Air 2 - Lightning Strike

Multitarget damage & Vulnerability. No cast time (doesn’t interrupt channels).

Synergies with Scepter Air 1 since you can keep channelling and also use this ability to damage and debuff the enemy. Previously it was just damage and ONLY on the primary target, modernising it with some utility and AoE.

Scepter Air 3 - Blinding Flash

Multitarget Blind & Weakness. 2 charges, no cast time.

Same notes about Blind & Weakness as before.
Same notes about no cast time as above.
2 charges allow some flexibility in the skill, either layering it on the same target or spreading it out.

Scepter Earth 1 - Stone Shards

Single target attack w/ 3 instances of the same damage & Bleeds. 20% chance each hit is a combo projectile.

This is almost exactly the same as Scepter Water 1, except it bleeds and can act as a combo projectile. Doesn’t seem to be a good reason it isn’t. Adding more RNG to the combat isn’t the greatest, especially if it’s for a mediocre effect. But do agree that 100% chance might be a bit too strong. Otherwise, the same notes apply.

Scepter Earth 2 - Rock Barrier & Hurl

Self HP shield, Toughness (stat) buff & Resistance (ignore non-damaging conditions) boon. Gives access to Hurl, consuming the Toughness buff & shooting 5x projectiles for 5 instances of damage, Bleeding and combo projectile.

Originally only had the Toughness buff, so you know it’s bad if you had to triple the amount of effects an ability has. All 3 effects contribute to survivability, as dictated by the Earth theme. Hurl presents some risk vs. reward in consuming the defensive buff for damage, though it’s generally not a life or death situation in PvE.

Scepter Earth 3 - Dust Devil

Ground targeted AoE. Damages & Cripples Bleeding enemies 3x. 1st hit blinds.

Small field that does a bit of damage & some conditional CC. Not particularly the best skill around but it’s somewhat better than what it was before. Previously just did 1 instance of damage at target & AoE around them. Pulsing damage & CC is more flexible. There’s synergy with the other Earth skills w/ bleeding but the effect isn’t strong enough to warrant it being conditional CC. Could’ve been basekit Cripple but additional damage & Bleed if already Bleeding.

Dagger
Short range. Note that Dagger is main hand (1, 2, 3) & off hand (4, 5). Meaning you can mix and match and not necessarily have to take all 5 (or 20) Dagger skills at once.

Dagger Fire 1 - Dragon’s Claw

Short range piercing shotgun.

Dagger is for short ranged (not quite melee) combat and this is a good example of it. Rewarded for getting up close when you manage to land all 3 shots on a target. Piercing to make it feel not horrible in AoE situations.

Dagger Fire 2 - Drake’s Breath

Channelled frontal cone; can move. Damages & Burns.

Same premise as the above. Channelled makes it even riskier since it’s close ranged, but does big damage especially for DoT builds.

Dagger Fire 3 - Burning Speed

Slide forward & damage in an AoE at the end. Leave behind a fire combo field that damages and Burns. Has an Evade (dodge) component.

Interesting skill that could be better. Evade component gives it skill expression, but there’s a 0.75s cast time so it’s pretty hard to pull off the dodge on higher ping. Recently it was changed to stop at the target. This means the fire field won’t ever hit the enemy if you have 1 targeted, which you should since it auto-targets if you don’t have 1 and you use an ability. Fire field should also happen at the end point. Other than that it’s a pretty good skill. Could possibly argue that it should also have a Combo Leap component but the skill is somewhat overloaded as is. Maybe only in PvE since Leap isn’t as impactful there as it is in PvP.

Dagger Fire 4 - Ring of Fire

PBAoE fire combo field. Damages, Burns on cast & Burns on passthrough.

Just a fire combo field that spawns underneath you. Short ranged, matching weapon. Combo field matching Eles “strengths”. Fire because, well, Fire attunement.

Dagger Fire 5 - Fire Grab

Short ranged frontal cone. Damages, +60% if they’re burning.

Simple ability that synergises w/ the rest of the weapon / attunement. Same notes about being short ranged apply.

Dagger Water 1 - Vapor Blade

Mid range piercing boomerang, damages & applies Vulnerability.

Pretty cool ability. Damage & debuff aren’t enough to warrant sticking around and using it though, making it a mediocre filler. Could have a heal attached to it to make it more attractive to the support side or apply more / longer Vulnerability stacks.

Dagger Water 2 - Cone of Cold

Healing version of the fire breath. 0.25x the damage and 2x the cooldown but gets a heal on it instead!

Pretty much just the healing fire breath. The exchange for the heal does seem pretty bad but player health pools compared to the enemy is a big difference. Only issue I have is that targeting is weird when you have a beneficial + damaging ability in 1. The game will auto-target the enemy and focus the breath on them, but you’ll probably try and move to position the breath to hit your allies which it won’t do because it’s still aiming at the enemy. Can de-target or position so allies are in between but doesn’t that make it any less janky in general.

Dagger Water 3 - Frozen Burst

PBAoE combo blast. Damages & Chills.

Damage is pretty weak and Chill isn’t more useful for Ele than other classes like it is for Reaper (Necromancer). Only real useful part is the Blast combo component for Aoe boons / auras / conditions / healing / cleanse, etc depending on the combo field.


Dagger Water 4 - Frost Aura & Transmute Frost

Self buff w/ Frost Aura, reducing damage taken by 10% & Chilling enemies that hit for 2s (1s ICD per attacker). Turns into Transmute Frost when affected by a Frost Aura, letting you deal PBAoE damage, heal & Regen.

Exact same comments as Magnetic Aura & Transmute Frost. This at least only has a 10s cooldown vs. 30s but its effect still should be AoE by default (there’s a talent which I’ll go into later). Transmute Frost also shouldn’t be on a 10s CD compared to PvP where it’s 3s. Other than that, its effects are what you expect from the Water version. It could maybe use 1 more offensive effect like Vulnerability or Chill or something. 

Dagger Water 5 - Cleansing Wave

PBAoE heal & cleanse.

Pretty simple ability; does what it says and fits Water theme & dagger constraints.

Dagger Air 1 - Lightning Whip

2x frontal attack, small cleave.

Simple ability since it’s a 1 skill. Borderline melee lightning attack; ticks the boxes.

Dagger Air 2 - Convergence

Delayed PBAoE. Damages, applies Weakness & grants Fury per enemy struck.

Used to be a frontal cone w/ the same effects, the delayed PBAoE makes it more interesting as you can prepare it. It’s also just more unique rather than having another frontal cone (yes it’s a PBAoE, but it’s delayed). Same notes about Weakness apply (stam regen penalty not that useful in PvE, damage reduction not reliable either). Fury is handy but in group content the healer / support will have it covered. Solo it’s useful because of the “per enemy struck” clause, making it last long enough to be useful.


Dagger Air 3 - Shocking Aura & Transmute Lightning

Self buff w/ Shocking Aura, stunning enemies that attack you for 1s (2s ICD per attacker). Turns into Transmute Lightning when affected by a Shocking Aura, letting you deal PBAoE damage & Stun.

Same comments as Magnetic Aura & Frost Aura. Also 10s but this is definitely a PvP skill as a 1s stun won’t really help if you get downed in like 5 hits as a squishy Ele. Could increase the stun duration or also apply Weakness to help survive. Transmute Lightning also should be a 3s CD. It could also have an additional effect like applying Swiftness because right now it’s just some damage and a stun.

Dagger Air 4 - Ride the Lightning

Gapcloser w/ PBAoE damage if it hits an enemy. Half cooldown if it does hit.

Simple gapcloser. Can be used as part of your damage rotation at the cost of some mobility. Auto-targeting may cause issues, launching you in unexpected directions.

Dagger Air 5 - Updraft

Evading short backflip w/ Swiftness & delayed CC.

Defensive dodge w/ CC attached. Use for CC or hold as an extra Evade, so there’s some risk involved. CC was changed to be delayed because of PvP, could’ve kept it separate. Even a little bit of damage would make sense on it since you’re launching a bunch of enemies into the air.

Dagger Earth 1 - Impale

Single target damage & Bleed.

No reason for this to be single target, especially since it’s very short ranged. Damages & Bleeds like every other Earth ability.

Dagger Earth 2 - Ring of Earth

2x PBAoE damage, Bleed & Cripple. Blocks projectiles.

Pretty cool animation, launching self into air and then crashing down into the earth. Damage & condition effects make sense w/ animation & theme. Extra skill expression w/ projectile blocking but that’s more of a PvP thing.

Dagger Earth 3 - Earthen Rush

Earth version of the Fire dash. Damages, Immobilizes (roots) enemies while Evading & combo Leaping.

Pretty much the same notes as Burning Speed. Has the Evade too but this one has 0.5s cast time as opposed to 0.75s for some reason. Also was made to stop at the enemy if targeted, meaning it won’t be hit by the trail of spikes behind. Acts as a Leap combo but since there are no Combo fields in Earth you’ll have to use one from another weapon / Attunement.

Dagger Earth 4 - Earthquake

PBAoE stomp that damages, knocks down and Blasts combos.

Very good damage and CC as well as Blasting combos. The only issue is that it’s VERY easy to cancel for some reason compared to other abilities with cast times. Cancelling with dodging makes sense but it’s also cancellable with a movement input, which honestly should be buffered. Should only be cancellable via dodging or sheathing w/ Z or pressing Esc.

Dagger Earth 5 - Churning Earth

Long cast PBAoE Cripple (slow) which explodes for Damage, Bleeding & Blasts combos.

Risk vs. reward since it has a long channel time where you’re vulnerable to CC & damage but the pay off is in big damage and to a lesser degree a combo Blast. It’s also VERY easy to cancel with movement input. Can also be comboed with Lightning Flash (utility blink, discussed below) to reposition the PBAoE without cancelling it, a nifty little combo.

Focus
Defense oriented. Off-hand only.

Focus Fire 4 - Flamewall

Ground targeted Fire combo field that damages & Burns.

Fire combo field that can be placed at range, making it versatile. Other than that it’s just like every other Fire combo field.

Focus Fire 5 - Fire Shield & Transmute Fire

Self buff w/ Fire Aura, burning enemies that attack & granting Might each time (1s ICD per attacker). Turns into Transmute Fire when affected by a Fire Aura, damaging & Burning enemies while granting allies Might.

Same note about aura application not being AoE. Same not about the Transmute not also being 3s in PvE. Skill itself is fine with its 3 effects, possible combo related effect if they want to lean into that.

Focus Water 4 - Freezing Gust

Single target Chill w/ a bit of damage.

There’s really no reason why this can’t have a small AoE around the target, especially since the chill is 3s and it’s on a 25s CD. Other than that, it needs something else since Chill doesn’t do much and the skill is practically unchanged since the release of the game.

Focus Water 5 - Comet

Targeted, slightly delayed AoE damage & Daze (same as stun, except players can still move whereas mobs can’t so it’s effectively a stun). Also Blasts combos.

A fine CC skill as there’s a bit of a delay so you can avoid it in PvP. Other than that it’s just CC with some damage. Blast is at the centre of the enemy hitbox which isn’t always that great depending on the hitbox.

Focus Air 4 - Swirling Winds

PBAoE area that blocks missiles.

Powerful defensive spell, lasts 6s so there’s enough time to get full value out of it unlike that 1 Earth spell that lasts 2s. Could stand to maybe also increase ally movespeed while in the field for a bit more utility, via a unique buff or Swiftness.

Focus Air 5 - Gale

Single target ranged unblockable knockdown.

Strong for PvP but in PvE it should just also be AoE. Other than that, it’s a dedicated CC spell on a huge cooldown which also should be reduced in PvE only.

Focus Earth 4 - Magnetic Wave

PBAoE damage & Cripple while also cleansing 3 Conditions & 3s projectile reflection. Also Blasts combos.

Strong skill that does a whole bunch of things at once. Only thing that could improve it is if there was some way to include Bleed into it, maybe rocks flying out as shrapnel in the animation just so it works more w/ DoT builds like other Earth skills.

Focus Earth 5 - Obsidian Flesh

3s of invulnerability. Channelled so you can only move.

Nerfed in PvE for no reason. Was formerly both 4s and wasn’t channelled. It’s already on a huge 50s cooldown so there’s already some risk in using it incorrectly, there was no need for it to be made into a channel.

Healing
Choose 1.

Arcane Brilliance - Arcane

PBAoE damage. Base heal, increased w/ per target hit. Blasts combos.

Arcane’s gimmick is that they always do critical damage, not that it matters since builds in PvE all revolve around getting to 100% crit anyway. Since there are only 5 Arcane skills, there’s no build revolved around Arcane to warrant not building crit. 

Skill itself specifically is the most offensive of the heals since it’s the only one that damages and potentially the biggest burst of healing. Tradeoff is that it’s the longest cooldown and is conditional for the amount healed, becoming weaker in single target. Bit of extra utility with the Blast component.

Ether Renewal - Cantrip

Channelled heal & cleanse per pulse. Pulses 8 times.

Cantrips are all defensive spells that activate instantly and this is no different. Does a medium amount of healing but the main reason you choose it is because of the huge cleansing component. The tradeoff is that it’s 2.25s of channelling where you’re both vulnerable and not attacking. In PvE there are better ways of cleansing, reserving this for PvP.

Glyph of Elemental Harmony - Glyph

Medium heal burst + a Boon depending on current Attunement.

Glyphs secondary effects change depending on the current Attunement. In this case, Fire = Might, Water = Regen, Air = Swiftness & Earth = Protection. However these Boons aren’t the main reason to take this heal as they don’t last long enough or they don’t scale that well (Regen won’t do much if you don’t have Healing Power). It’s the biggest non-conditional burst heal out of the base heal skills.

Signet of Restoration - Signet

Passively heal per spell cast (so any weapon skill). Active is a low heal burst.

Signets have both passive & active components. Passives are on cooldown while recharging by default, so there’s some downside to using the active if you don’t absolutely need it. This heal has the most passive healing but is the worst in terms of burst healing.

Utility
Choose 3.

Arcane Blast - Arcane

Single target ranged crit nuke. 3 charges. Acts as a combo Projectile.

Decent single target damage, which is what’s advertised. Charges allow holding at least 2 until burst phase if needed, some extra skill layered in. Not that interesting though, especially since it’s a non-Elemental spell for the Elementalist class.

Arcane Power - Arcane

PBAoE buff that guarantees crits on attacks per stack. Also grants Ferocity (crit damage stat) per stack. More stacks for self than allies (4 vs 2).

Absolutely awful since stacks are consumed per hit, meaning a weak attack consuming the stack would completely gimp its effectiveness. Could try and time it but there’s usually a lot going on in terms of attacks going out. Could really be duration based rather than stack based, especially since this is a 45s CD probably because of PvP.

Arcane Shield - Arcane

Block the next 3 attacks. Explodes for crit damage if it blocks all 3. Also breaks stun.

Mostly used to break out of a stun. Same note about stacks vs. duration, at least in PvE. Compared to other defensive Utilities that break stun, it’s more on the defensive side without completely stopping you from attacking.

Arcane Wave - Arcane

AoE version of Arcane Blast. 2 charges. Blasts combos.

Literally just the AoE version of Arcane Blast, except it actually Blasts combos.

Armor of Earth - Cantrip

Break out of stuns, grant self Protection & Stability & Barrier per boon you have.

The other defensive stun break that doesn’t gimp damage. Offers more mitigation rather than blocking the attacks, meaning you could still get downed. The mitigation is standardised at 6s though as opposed to the stacks. Conditional barrier is kind of stupid though. It should have a base amount and then increase per boon. Luckily it grants the Protection & Stability then the barrier in terms of logic so there is a bit of a base value, technically.

Cleansing Fire - Cantrip

Cleanse 5 conditions & Burn enemies in PBAoE. Gain Might per condition cleansed. 2 charges.

An actual good & safe cleansing option without sacrificing too much damage. Charges allow some flexibility, possibly even using it offensively. Might per condition cleansed also rewards cleansing properly but not that useful in group content since you should have max Might anyway. Possibly extra Burn stacks instead.

Lightning Flash - Cantrip

Blink to & damage an area.

No reason why this shouldn’t also act as a stun break in PvE (which was removed 10 years ago). Other than that it’s just kind of boring. Yes you can use it to reposition certain skills but other than that it needs something else other than some pitiful damage, maybe AoE Swiftness & Weakness per enemy hit.

Mist Form - Cantrip

Breaks stun & Invulnerability for 3s. You can move very quickly but cannot attack.

The most defensive of the stun breaks. The trade off is that it’s a huge cooldown of 60s and you cannot attack at all. Can change Attunements during this so there’s some flexibility in that regard. Might also need a healing or cleansing component attached to it (in PvE) to make it stand out because right now it’s strictly a PvP ability.

Conjure Earth Shield - Conjure

Creates an Earth Shield in your hands (replacing weapon skills) & target location. Wielders get Toughness (armour stat) and Vitality (health stat).
a) Shield Smack: Melee damage & Bleeding cleave.
b) Shield Smash: Melee damage & more Bleeding cleave.
c) Crippling Shield: Line boomerang damage & Cripple. Double damage & Bleeding if you have any Barrier.
Stone Sheath: Block next attack within 2.25s & PBAoE damage & Bleed. Gain Barrier if an attack is blocked.
Magnetic Surge: PBAoE damage & Daze and grant self Magnetic Aura.
Magnetic Shield: PBAoE damage & pull. Grant self Barrier & Protection per enemy pulled. Unblockable.
Fortify: Invulnerable but unable to move or attack at all. Can blink with Lightning Flash.

Conjure’s gimmick is that they create a weapon in both your hand and at target location. This differs from Engineer’s Kits where only they get the weapon. It seriously should just act the same because a) having to run up and press F to pick up a weapon is the dumbest thing ever and b) someone stealing your weapon is the most frustrating thing ever. Get rid of the passive stats and the 2nd weapon and make it like Kits.

Onto the actual weapon, it’s the most defensive of the 5 as expected. Works around Barriers & Bleeding which fits the Earth theme of DoTs and defence. Also has CC and pulls to help being a melee weapon. Don’t get much use out of this in PvE and even if it was better in PvE, you’d only use 1 or 2 abilities before dumping it immediately. This can be resolved by it becoming more like Kits, where you can jump into the weapon anytime and use what you need at the time.

Conjure Flame Axe - Conjure

Creates a Flame Axe in your hands & target location. Wielders get Power (direct damage stat) & Condition Damage (DoT damage stat).
a) Lava Axe: Single target ranged damage & Might for self.
b) Double Lava Axe: same as above, but there are 2 projectiles.
Explosive Lava Axe: ground targeted AoE damage & Blast. Grants Fired Up, allowing Double Lava Axe to be used.
Burning Retreat: almost identical to the Staff version. Also grants Fired Up.
Ring of Fire: almost identical to the Dagger version. Also grants Fired Up.
Flame Leap: Combo Leap to enemy, dealing Damage, Burning & Fired Up.

Not a really good look if 2 of the 5 abilities are the same as abilities from other weapons. There’s some auto attack weaving involved w/ Fired Up (doesn’t stack) so there’s some nuance involved. There’s some Burning involved but they don’t last very long. Could use a lot more Burning (possibly via Fired Up buff) to make it a contender for DoT builds because right now, no one ever uses this Utility.

Conjure Frost Bow - Conjure

Creates a Frost Bow in your hands & target location. Wielders get Condition Duration (DoT duration stat) & Healing Power (healing stat).
Water Arrow: Targeted damage & AoE heal. Grants Water Arrow stacks (up to 2, 5s duration).
Frost Volley: Multiple single target attacks. Damages, applies Vulnerability & acts as a Combo Projectile per shot. Damage increased per Water Arrow.
Frost Fan: Ashe W that shotguns and pierces. Damages & Chills. +1 arrow per Water Arrow stack (base 7 arrows).
Frost Storm: Ground targeted AoE. Damages w/ dumb damage reduction per hit & Bleeds. More projectiles per Water Arrow stack (base 24 impacts).
Deep Freeze: Single target damage, Chill & Stun after cast time. +0.5s duration to Stun per Water Arrow stack (base 3s).

More utility & damage based than the usual Water skills. Requires uptime of Water Arrows for max value on skills. Should remove healing from this skill and create a separate Water based Conjure under Healing Utilities, leaving this to be the support / utility option w/ some damage. Other than that the skills synergise with the auto due to the Water Arrow stacks, except for the weird Bleeding on Frost Storm. Could’ve added a “deal X more damage if chilled” clause somewhere too. Same note about the dumb damage reduction on “storm” type abilities, make it pulsing & consistent.

Conjure Lightning Hammer - Conjure

Creates a Lightning Hammer in your hands & target location. Wielders get Ferocity (crit damage) & Precision (crit chance).
a) Lightning Swing: melee cleave.
b) Static Swing: melee cleave.
c) Thunderclap: melee AoE, damaging, Blinding & Blasting combos.
Lightning Leap: Combo leap to target, damaging in an AoE & granting Quickness (skill animations are faster).
Wind Blast: Damage & Launch back a single target. Also grant Superspeed.
Call Lightning: PBAoE damaging strikes w/ damage reduction per hit.
Static Field: Almost identical to the Staff version.

Damage & CC, fitting the Air theme. Same notes about Conjures apply. Melee weapon so skills fit together in keeping up uptime on enemies. Same notes about damage reduction per hit apply. Standardise that. Could do with an actual unique 5th ability, but at least this time there’s only 1 copied ability. Maybe an initial stun around self and then a lightning field that follows. Possibly too strong for PvP but oh well, not like that game mode gets any updates (no I’m not bitter about PvP ruining things for PvE ☺️).

Glyph of Elemental Power - Glyph

Stun break. Gain 5 stacks. Each stack makes your attacks deal increased damage & apply a Condition depending on Attunement when used: 
Fire: Burn | Water: Chill | Air: Vulnerability | Earth: Bleeding

Weird to have a stun break associated with this skill when you want to use it on cooldown. Yes there’s something that could be said about risk vs. reward but it would’ve fit better on Lightning Flash (no I’m not bitter). Used to be duration based rather than stack based, probably because of PvP shenanigans. Overall this ability is just more damage on something you’re already doing (using spells) w/ some consideration on when to use it as the Conditions don’t change after it’s used.

Glyph of Lesser Elementals - Glyph

Summon a weak elemental depending on Attunement: 
Fire: Burns & grants Might | Water: Chills & provides Ice Combo field | Air: is ranged, grants Swiftness & cleanses Cripple, Immobilize or Chill | Earth: applies Weakness, tankier. 
40s CD but lasts for 120s, cap of 5 summons.

Don’t like pets, won’t ever like pets. Unlike other pets though, these despawn on mount which is very annoying. There’s also a case where you need to precast a bunch before a boss fight which is more downtime and variance if you can’t spawn 5 of them in time (using mushrooms / potions or whatever that reset your cooldowns). Pets themselves are weak and apply non-comparable things, like boons vs. a combo field vs. a cleanse vs. being tankier. They should all do their unique things via the same method (boons, conditions, etc).

Glyph of Renewal - Glyph

Ranged res with a cast time. 
Fire: GA effect for 15s on res-ee | Water: full heal on res | Air: res & pull them to your location | Earth: PBAoE res (3).

PvP ability w/ some use in PvE (raid situations). Provides some safety since it’s a ranged res vs. having to run up to someone and press F (which is used for practically everything). Opportunity cost of taking a safe res vs. any of the other utilities.

Glyph of Storms - Glyph

Ground targeted AoE storm. 
Fire: pulsing burning field | Water: projectiles that chill and have that dumb damage reduction per hit | Air: same but vulnerability instead of chill | Earth: pulsing bleeding & blindness field.

First complaint about this is the projectile damage reduction per hit for Water & Air. If the damage was too high, it should’ve been reduced linearly. Second complaint is the varying cooldowns per Attunement. If Air was too strong (which it was, to be fair), reduce the damage, don’t make it ~3x the cooldown of Fire. Finally, they all have differing durations, why? Just standardise them so they’re more comparable and you choose depending on what you need more clearly. Other than that they all do what you expect each Attunement to do, though Water could use more in the support category since Chill is, again, not that good in PvE in general.

Signet of Air - Signet

Passive: movespeed. Active: Breaks stun, damage, blind & apply Vulnerability to target & nearby enemies.

Good example of a stun break since you only want to use it in defensive situations (blinding the enemy helps survivability).

Signet of Earth - Signet

Passive: toughness (armour stat). Active: Damage, Bleed & Immobilize target.

Other than the Immobilize, this doesn’t really help with tankiness. Possibly needs a Barrier aspect associated with it. Also needs to be AoE. Could keep Immobilize to be a single target only if that’s an issue because of ~PvP~.

Signet of Fire - Signet

Passive: precision (crit chance). Active: Damage & Burn target & nearby enemies.

Fine, not too interesting. Used to need it to reach crit cap for Power builds (non-DoT). Now only used in Condition builds because of the huge Burn on a low cooldown.

Signet of Water - Signet

Passive: -20% Condition duration. Active: Damage & Chill enemies while healing & reviving (not a complete revive) allies around ground targeted area.

The passive isn’t really helpful as you’re still being affected by those Conditions. Also doesn’t really fit w/ the rest of the ability. It’s one of the few Utilities that heal and is really the only reason to take it since the damage is low, Chill isn’t that helpful and the revive is 5% of their downed health bar (reaching 100% = revive). Passive could be changed to be increased healing power or boon duration to fit better.

Elite
Choose 1.

Conjure Fiery Greatsword - Conjure

Creates a Fiery Greatsword in your hands & target location. Target location is also damaged & Burned. Wielders get Power (direct damage stat) & Condition Damage (DoT damage stat). Randomly casts Lesser Fiery Eruption, damaging & Burning in an AoE every 6s.
Flame Wave: Medium ranged piercing projectile that damages.
Fiery Eruption: Medium ranged targeted AoE that only Burns, no direct damage.
Fiery Whirl: Tryndamere E. Damages, Cripples, Evades & Whirls combos.
Fiery Rush: Dash to enemy, damaging & leaving damaging Fire (not field) behind. Ignores movement speed slows. No Burning.
Firestorm: Ground targeted pulsing damage field.

Decent Elite, if not for the fact it’s a 3 minute long cooldown. Target damage & Burn isn’t needed, seems to be there just to fit the animation. Randomly cast abilities are annoying & unreliable. What doesn’t make sense is that it does the same amount of Burning as the activated version, but also does direct damage making it objectively better than an activated ability but is called “Lesser”. Technically has a 1s higher CD but doesn’t require a cast. Auto is fine, could use some Burning interaction since you’re whacking someone with fireballs. Fiery Eruption needs direct damage, it doesn’t make sense otherwise. Fiery Whirl is okay; it does more damage against bigger hitbox enemies which is dumb and should be standardised. Fiery Rush needs to have Burning on it considering it leaves a Fire section behind. Also needs to be a combo field to make it consistent with its animation. Otherwise get rid of the fire wall because it forcibly doesn’t generate if you use it while in a hitbox, meaning stationary enemies are never hit by the fire field. Firestorm just needs some burning, otherwise it being a pulsing field rather than damage reduced projectiles is great.

Glyph of Elementals - Glyph

Summon a better pet. Can be commanded for an extra ability.
Fire: Burns & applies Might. Command for more damage & Burning.
Water: Chills & creates Ice Combo fields. Command for knockback, heal & cleanse.
Air: Ranged, applies Swiftness & cleanses Crippled, Immobilized & Chilled. Command for a stun.
Earth: Tanky, applies Weakness on enemy. Command for Protection for allies & Cripple & Immobilize for enemies around it.

Bigger & better version of Glyph of Lesser Elementals, but you can only have 1 which is much more manageable in terms of balance. Pets are still going to act like pets so if you don’t like pets (like me), you won’t feel good about using it. Take Fire for damage, Water for healing, Air for CC & Earth for something to tank & CC. Also for some reason Water lasts 60s despite the tooltip saying all last 120s.

Tornado - Cantrip

Grant self Stability & turn into a tornado, replacing weapon skills, preventing Heal or Utility skills from being used or changing Attunements. Pulse every 3s for 4 pulses which damages & knocksback. Become a walking Lightning combo field that’s constantly Whirling for automatic Lightning Whirls.
Electrified Tornado: shoot out bouncing lightning, damaging enemies.
Dust Tornado: shoot out dust devils, damaging & blinding enemies.
Debris Tornado: shout out debris, damaging & knocking back enemies.
Elemental Requiem: shoot out random effects, damaging & applying Vulnerability, Bleeding or Cripple.
Dust Charge: Charge forward, damaging & launching enemies.

Honestly one of the worst skills Eles have. Trading everything away for a bunch of nothing. May have once been useful in PvP but the fact that it has a 150s CD (it’s lower in PvP for some reason???) and it takes away your ability to do anything else makes it absolutely garbage. Also where’s the Elemental part of it? It also doesn’t fit the Cantrip theme either since it takes 1 second to activate and only applies Stability or CCs enemies. You’re still vulnerable to damage & CC during all of this.

Traits
Non-coloured Traits are auto picked if the tree is chosen. Coloured Traits are a choice of 1.
Fire

Empowering Flame

Grant Power while in Fire.

More damage while in Fire attunement, fitting its theme. Could also make it give power in general and doubled in Fire to make the other attunements stronger / less crappy like Power Overwhelming below. Maybe something for Condition builds too, like Condition Damage in addition to Power.

Burning Precision

Increased Burning duration you inflict & crits have a chance to inflict Burn.

More damage for both power & condition builds (less DoT duration stat you need, the more can be put into DoT damage).

Conjurer

Gain Fire Aura when someone picks up your Conjured weapons.

Absolutely garbage in PvE. Requires Conjures to be taken and puts a lot of value into the Fire Aura.It could be interesting to have a theme around Auras if they weren’t some crap by themselves.

Burning Fire

Cast Lesser Cleansing Fire when you have 3 conditions on you.
Lesser Cleansing Fire: Cleanse 3 conditions on self & PBAoE Burn. Gain Might per condition cleansed.

Survivability trait. Strictly for PvP since cleansing 3 conditions every 40s isn’t that useful.

Sunspot

Gain Fire Aura & PBAoE damage when switching to Fire / Overload (Tempest). Cannot crit.

More benefits for switching to Fire. Benefits match the theme, all round fitting trait. Crit modifier was added due to PvP, not sure why it’s in PvE.

Burning Rage

Sunspot inflicts Burning & radius is increased. Condition Damage is increased.

Upgrades Sunspot to be better for Condition builds; take it if you’re building for DoTs.

Smothering Auras

Fire Auras have +33% increased duration. Applying auras removes 1 condition to the recipient. Transmuting Auras removes 2 conditions.

Support choice for this portion. Not too useful in PvE since Conditions are only an issue in PvP.

Power Overwhelming

While >= 10 Might stacks, gain Power. Doubled while in Fire.

More power damage almost all the time in grouped content. Take it if building power.

Pyromancer’s Training

Fire weapon skills (1 - 5) have 20% reduced cooldown. Deal +10% strike (direct, not DoT) damage against Burning enemies.

More cooldown reduction = more abilities = more player agency = more fun! More damage against Burning enemies fits the theme, realistically it’s a flat +10% damage.

Persisting Flames

Fire Fields from weapon skills last 2s longer. Fire Fields grant a stack every time they hit an enemy, up to 10 for +10% strike damage.

Damage up for both DPS builds. Fields lasting longer means more damage + Burning. Stacks obviously mean more power damage.

Pyromancer’s Puissance

Gain Might when using any skill (1 - 5) while attuned to Fire. Leaving Fire or finishing Fire Overload activates Flame Expulsion.
Flame Expulsion: consume Might on self for PBAoE damage, Burning & Might for allies, increased per Might consumed.

Bit of a weird trait / skill. Granting others Might suggests it’s a support ability, but the damage & Burning suggests it’s a DPS ability. Damage & Burning don’t outweigh what you get from Persisting Flames and it also costs you 10 Might. Might granted lasts a decent amount of time though, which makes it lean closer to a support trait. However, it does require going into Fire meaning you’ll miss out on the other trees in exchange for mediocre damage since you’re not building for it or utility that’s not useful in PvE.

Blinding Ashes

Blind enemies that you Burn. 8s ICD per enemy.

PvP option. A blind every 8s isn’t that useful, especially compared to the others.
Air

Zephyr’s Speed

+5% crit chance. +25% movespeed while in Air.

Crit chance added here due to the rework of a problematic set of unique class buffs (Ranger in particular). Fits because if you are speccing Air, you’ll want crit. Movespeed is handy but again, would’ve been nice to have half the effect in the other elements.

Zephyr’s Boon

Grant 5s of Fury & Swiftness to allies you grant Auras to (self included).

Support choice based around Auras; makes them less crap. Crit + movespeed buffs fit the Air theme. Could also add an effect specific to Shocking Aura, even just a longer duration on the above Boons.

One with Air

Gain Superspeed when attuning to Air.

Can only see this being useful in PvP where crits are less likely & you won’t get much opportunity to apply Auras to allies.

Ferocious Winds

Gain Ferocity based on 7% of Precision.

Raw damage buff, building upon what’s already present in Power builds.

Electric Discharge

Single target damage & Vulnerability when switching to Air / finishing Air Overload. Crits for +100% the usual amount.

More benefits for switching to Air. Could’ve done with a Shocking Aura in PvE too. This one retains the ability to crit because it’s in Air I guess.

Inscription

Gain a Boon when casting a Glyph. Glyphs recharge 20% quicker.
Fire: Might | Water: Regen | Air: Swiftness | Earth: Protection

Boons given are pretty bad as it’s 1 stack of Might, Regen requiring Healing Power to scale, Swiftness being easily given / not needed and Protection only lasting 3s. Glyphs recharging quicker might be useful but not enough to warrant choosing them if you’re not already using them. Big opportunity cost compared to the others.

Raging Storm

Crits grant 4s Fury, 8s ICD. Gain Ferocity while under Fury.

Helps sustain Fury duration and makes Fury a little better for yourself. Better in open world solo play.

Stormsoul

Deal +10% strike damage to hard CC’d (cannot attack) or defiant (CC immune) enemies. Outgoing Stun duration increased by 33%.

+10% damage in boss fights is huge since they’re almost always CC immune. And when they’re not, the group will CC it to make it even more vulnerable. Damage multipliers on top of damage multipliers. Stun duration increase is nice but not that many skills apply Stun specifically. Might’ve been better to be hard CC in general. Take if doing group content with a boss.

Aeromancer’s Training

Gain Ferocity, doubled in Air. Air weapon skills recharge 20% faster.

More damage via Ferocity and via more Air skills. Same notes about CDR apply. Little bland though, could use something relating to Swiftness or CC or critting.

Bolt to the Heart

+20% strike damage against enemies below 50% HP.

It’s extra damage under a threshold, nothing else to say.

Fresh Air

Recharge Air attunement cooldown on crits. Gain Ferocity buff when attuning to Air.

Allows a huge amount of flexibility when critting (so always), especially with Tempest Overloads. Even though it’s more fun & interactive, it loses out to Bolt to the Heart in terms of raw damage which is the name of the game at the end of the day.

Lightning Rod

Cast Lightning Rod when you hard CC an enemy.
Lightning Rod: Damage & apply Weakness.

PvP option. There’s not enough CC in the kit to justify taking this over the other 2, and even then it’s only really taken for the Weakness.
Earth

Stone Flesh

-7% strike damage taken while in Earth.

Become tankier while in Earth, makes sense. Could use something for Condition builds though, like Condition Duration if Condition Damage is going on Fire. Same note about half effect in other elements too.

Earth’s Embrace

Gain Barrier when attuning to Earth from another element.

On demand Barrier for more survivability & sustain. Attunements have a 10s cooldown when leaving by default, 8s total to leave and re-enter Earth for Weaver and 20s if Overload Earth was used by Tempest. While it’s a sound idea for a defensive trait, its effects aren’t strong enough for its effective cooldown, not to mention you’d be screwing yourself over just entering and leaving Earth for a shield. 

Previously casted Armor of Earth when below 50% HP, granting Protection, Stability & breaking stuns. So its main function has changed too from emergency defense to sustain. Possibly re-adding Protection / Stability if the Barrier breaks w/ an ICD.

Serrated Stones

+20% Bleeding duration you inflict. +5% damage against Bleeding enemies.

Offensive option. Revolves around DoTs which fits the theme.

Elemental Shielding

Auras you grant also grant Protection.

Support option. Makes Auras a little bit better. Could also have something specific for Magnetic Aura to make it stand out even more from the other Aura traits. Probably not Stability as that’s more of an emergency / on demand Boon rather than 100% uptime like Protection. Perhaps Resolution, the Condition version of Protection.

Earthen Blast

PBAoE damage & Cripple when attuning to Earth / completing Earth Overload. Cannot crit.

Earth version of the Fire PBAoE, so the same notes apply. Could also use Bleeding somewhere, either in base or another trait. Can’t crit because of PvP, yippee.

Strength of Stone

Gain Condition Damage based on 10% of Toughness. Bleed enemies you Immobilize (3s ICD).

More DoT damage the tankier you are. Pick if you chose this tree for the DoT damage. Also adds some more Bleed for rooting enemies (requires specific weapons or utilities taken though). Could be changed to CC in general to make it more universal.

Rock Solid (you will lose!)

PBAoE Stability when attuning to Earth from another element.

Support option for on demand Stability. Same notes about the effective cooldown apply here. Whilst Stability is very powerful when used correctly, building around it and messing up your rotation isn’t worth it, especially for 2 whole seconds of it.

Earthen Blessing

-33% duration of Chilled, Cripple & Immobilize on self. Restore endurance when receiving any of them.

PvP option, there’s no way those 3 Conditions are prevalent enough in PvE to warrant taking it.

Geomancer’s Training

-10% strike damage from nearby enemies. Earth weapon skills recharge 20% faster.

General tankiness from enemies in close range. More Earth skills, you know the drill. It being direct damage reduction as opposed to Toughness does seem like it’s trying not to make Strength of Stone too powerful.

Diamond Skin

Remove 1 condition when hit while >= 75% HP. 1s ICD.


Some utility to reward being tanky. ICD is understandable, don’t want it too strong in multitarget fights but HP conditional seems like it’s only there because of PvP, it should be reduced. Could also be changed to be Conditions removed every X seconds in combat, X reduced every time hit to make it a viable option for when you’re successfully dodging / blocking.

Written in Stone

Signets recharge 20% faster & retain passives while recharging.

Technically the offensive option as it means more Signet of Fire, the big Burn utility (and also Signet of Healing but to a lesser degree of effectiveness). Out of all the Utility specific traits, this has got to be the most effective and useful of the lot since it changes functionality in a good way rather than slapping on a small Boon / Aura.

Stone Heart

Gain a buff for 4s when entering Earth and 2s when exiting where you cannot be crit.

Hyperspecific active mitigation. Don’t believe most PvP builds have a high chance of critting except for very specific ones. PvE mobs also don’t have a high chance of critting either. Should just be changed to strike damage reduction instead. Keep the buff implementation though, it allows flexibility as opposed to the original “can’t be crit while in Earth” variation.
Water

Soothing Mist

PBAoE HoT over 10s while in Water, refreshing duration every 3s.

Extra form of healing while in Water. Base form is not effective for non-Healing builds though (DPS / Support). Unfortunately there’s nothing that directly makes it better for those builds either. Could’ve possibly had a trait that made it debuff enemies for the Ele only (to avoid having to take Ele specifically for this buff for other players). Additionally could be made into Regen so it’s affected by other traits; will require adjustments like the cleansing Regen one (like a higher refresh timer).

Soothing Ice

Gain Regen & Frost Aura when crit, 20s ICD.

Requires both being hit and being crit and has a big CD. Almost the default option if not needing the Burning & Chilled cleansing for support / low damage builds.

Piercing Shards

+33% Vulnerability duration inflicted by you. +10% strike damage against Vulnerable foes (any stacks), doubled in Water.

Offensive option. Plays into the Vulnerability (support) theme of Water (which is support & healing). That being said, Vulnerability is so common amongst even 5 players so the increased duration isn’t even that useful. Possibly change it to applying extra stacks or Vulnerability is twice as effective for the Ele, like every other trait from other classes that improve Vulnerability.

Stop, Drop, and Roll

Dodging removes Burning & Chilled from self & nearby allies. 10s ICD.

Some extra on-demand cleansing. Worthless if the fight has no Burning or Chilled, which means the default choice for support builds would be Soothing Ice by elimination.

Healing Ripple

PBAoE heal when attuning to Water from another element or Overload Water.

Water version of the “do X when changing to Y” trait. Crit heals don’t exist so it’s just an extra bit of healing. No reason not to in PvE to be honest. Makes crit not a dead stat for healers and it’s less miserable to see a crit of 100 damage when you crit for 5k healing. Other than that, could use something for support like a cleanse or Chilling / applying Vulnerable to enemies.

Soothing Disruption

Cantrips grant Regen & Vigor.

Equally as bad as the Conjure and Glyph ones. Same notes for them apply. At least the Glyph one reduced the cooldown.

Cleansing Wave

PBAoE Condition cleanse when attuning to Water.

This could easily be merged with Healing Ripple (at least in PvE) to grant another slot here. Something Healing related as none of the 3 are currently Healing based.

Flow like Water

+10% strike damage while >= 75% HP. Blocking / Evading an attack heals you.

Offensive option. Adds another layer of keeping your HP above a certain level, though if you play like me you want to be topped off always because of how squishy Eles are. The 2nd portion helps maintain the 1st portion, synergising with itself.

Aquamancer’s Training

+15% Healing to others. Water weapon skills recharge 20% faster.

Constant healing to others increase. More Water skills = you know the drill 2.0.

Cleansing Water

Granting Regen also cleanses 1 Condition on the recipient.

Fine option if cleansing is needed. Following along with the idea of Soothing Mist being a Regen instead of a unique buff, this entire section could be changed to revolve around Soothing Mist and have a utility, offensive and healing option.

Powerful Aura

Auras granted to self also granted to nearby allies.

This should be basekit for the weapon skills that grant Auras and be changed to apply Regen on Auras. Could also be moved to where Cleansing Wave currently is and replaced with an offensive option for Soothing Mist so there’s a choice between utility, offense and healing.

Soothing Power

Soothing Mist’s healing is twice as powerful.

Healing option, nothing else to be said.
