Guild Wars 2 Notes
General
Good combat, mixture of action and tab targeting.
Targeting sometimes gets annoying when mobs surround / get behind you. Skills won’t fire until you manually face them which is fine for the action combat skills, very annoying for the enemy targeted ones. Something like FFXIV’s legacy camera movement would work wonders and make the targeting feel less clunky.
Has stamina + dodging, no active blocking. Most abilities are ground targeted or enemy targeted w/ tab targeting.
No trinity, but the most efficient way to play for endgame stuff is with pseudo trinity anyway (tank / kiter, healer, DPS, support = buff & healer / DPS hybrid).
Quickness + Alacrity buffs shape the meta. Do not like these buffs as it feels awful not to have them, whereas no Might (+Damage) or Fury (+Crit chance) don’t feel nearly as bad when you don’t have them.
Wiki integration is great, and would be perfect if there was an in-game client rather than having to open it in a browser.
Again, spoilt by FFXIV with having all classes on 1 character, really miss that since I end up creating either 1 character but cloning it for other classes (GW2), using almost default presets for the non main classes (BDO) or just not having more than 1 class (WoW).
Feels like this is just so they can get you to pay for character slots.
Can’t have every crafting profession on the same character, forced to have multiple characters for that.
There is sort of a shared levelling system post level 80, but they’re for utilities rather than combat stuff (auto-loot which should’ve been basekit, crafting, mount skills, etc).
Awful microtransactions, lots of FOMO. Should strictly be for cosmetics and not convenience. Even more insulting is that equipment & skill loadouts are both separate and character bound, so if you play more than 1 character it’s absolutely overpriced.
Loot. Boxes.
Being able to buy currency in exchange for in-game currency is bad. The effects aren’t too awful as the game has horizontal progression that’s somewhat easy to reach the highest level but still, being able to buy progression (via gear, materials, etc) is dumb.
People often laud the fact that it’s horizontal progression and they feel like they don’t need to grind anything on a gear cycle, but end up permanently grinding for gold to achieve anything. Sometimes I feel bad that I’m not grinding the most profitable content for gold.
That being said, there are a lot of open world events that are both profitable and fun. It’s just when it becomes a grind that sucks out the enjoyment of it.
Little instanced content that I feel like I could quickly jump into, both because there’s very few and the party finder is absolute trash.
Global trading post is great, except when the gold barons are able to manipulate it.
Inventory management is annoying, junk being dropped by everything taking up space and since you have to pay for gear sets your gear will be sitting in the inventory too. Also filled with random items that have very specific uses like teleporters & keys, etc.
Way too many currencies & keys & materials.
Imagine paying 500g to unlock basic party leadership functionality.
Mounts are great, but some are redundant (Springer vs. Skyscale, Skimmer vs. Skiff).
UI needs more customisation, currently only size & where minimap is.
Buff bar is awful, a tiny row of icons that doesn’t seem to have any priority. This excludes boons (positive buffs) and conditions (negative buffs) which are common across all classes; these have their own row.
Skill tooltips are nice and detailed, they also have easy to understand icons.
Infusion stacking is the worst visual design I’ve seen in my life in a game. Not being able to turn it off / hide those players is just as awful.
There is so much visual clutter when doing large meta events. This is allegedly being fixed in June w/ a filter, 10+ years after launch.
Way too much RNG in everything: loot boxes, random skin unlocks, microtransactions (can’t even choose what skin you want for mounts most of the time), gear, mob drops, even enemy prefix augments like in PoE (ones that require you to stay melee / ranged on a boss that teleports randomly, great design), etc.
Balance split between PvE & PvP took years but eventually happened, meaning some skills that are useless are now less useless in their respective modes (separate numbers, slightly different effects, etc).
There is underwater combat with its own set of weapons & abilities, but it’s not that great. Not awful but not really part of the game at all, so won’t include it here at all.
There’s also a couple of skills when you’re downed / drowning (downed underwater). Won’t be including those either as they’re mostly damage / helping you survive long enough to get saved.
Combos are an interesting mechanic but they’ve pretty much been unchanged since release. Their importance and effectiveness have gone down while new classes, specialisations, weapons + skills have made them even more irrelevant. Why bother comboing for boons when another class can press a couple of buttons for permanent buff uptime.
Elementalist
Elementalist Combat
Love the concept, execution could be better.
Swap between 4 elements: fire, water, air & earth.
Fire is designed to have heavy damage & burning (DoT).
Water is designed to have support (utility) & healing.
Air is designed to have heavy damage & CC.
Earth is designed to have DoTs & defense.
Each element has its own set of weapon skills.
Utility skills are the same but some change depending on current element (glyph).
In exchange for 4 elements, Ele’s cannot swap weapons in combat.
Most of the time, the best way to play the class is to stick to 2 elements, meaning half the kit is ignored.
This coupled with the fact that it was originally designed to have more but slightly less impactful / specific skills makes it feel bad to ignore half the kit.
The only builds that go through all elements are Weaver (with Weave Self) and hammer Catalyst (with Grand Finale).
The fact that you can’t swap weapons in combat means that you’re sometimes useless when forced to be ranged if you’re using a melee weapon. This can be countered with fight knowledge / using ranged weapons / Conjures / sitting on your thumb.
Absolutely hate that Ele has very little HP and very little armour; they effectively have half the effective health of Warrior.
This is meant to be balanced by the fact that Ele has more active defense (shields, immunities) but they’ve all been nerfed / changed leaving a wet piece of tissue paper.
Understand that PvP is balanced around this, no reason for this to be the case in PvE.
Conjures are awful. Imagine having to pick up (F) a weapon. Completely replaces your weapon bar and (for DPS purposes) you’re encouraged to use the biggest damaging abilities then drop it. Damage is totally gimped if some random person takes your other weapon or it despawns because you have to go through a dumb pick up animation.
Power budget includes access to a lot of combo fields. The importance of combos has changed over the years so how much of the power budget it takes up should be adjusted (there are much easier ways to get boons these days).
Auras are also meant to be a prominent feature for Eles but they haven’t really been changed since release either. They last for very little time and are unaffected by boon duration stats, so their effects while decently strong are rarely felt, especially since it requires you to get hit.
Elementalist Abilities
Staff

Staff Fire 1 - Fireball

Targeted projectile AoE for damage & 1s burning (only PvE, will only be doing PvE version).

All “1” abilities are the auto-attack so they’re going to be somewhat basic. Fits with the main theme of Fire which is direct damage and DoTs. Also fits the theme of a staff being ranged and slow. Won’t be mentioning if it fits the theme for other abilities, will only mention it if it doesn’t. Feels clunky with the cast time & it being a targeted skill in a mostly action combat game. Especially annoying since your character won’t turn to face and cast if they’re behind you.

Staff Fire 2 - Lava Font

Ground targeted AoE field for damage & 1s burning. Fire field for combos.

Simple ground targeted AoE for damage. It’s quick and has a low cooldown so not as heavily punished if things move out of it, which it will since its size is pretty small. Combo field lasts for 4s so there’s some time to get some combos off. 

Staff Fire 3 - Flame Burst

Targeted AoE damage & burning. Also blinds.

Simple AoE around the target enemy. Same annoyances about enemy targeted skills apply. Blind is also an annoying condition because of how detrimental or useless it is. It completely negates the next singular outgoing attack. This makes it either extremely effective against slower classes or borderline useless against persistent DPS / AoE classes. Should be made more standardised by either making all attacks miss for a far lower duration or make it so it forces the affected to break targeting and darken the screen. The latter may be annoying as CC affecting the player (as in the person playing) isn’t that great by design; it’s annoying, frustrating and could be worked around by putting gamma up to a 100 or something. Blindness has the same issue as the old dodge stats from LoL, WoW and FFXIV where it’s frustrating when it happens and is a minor inconvenience to get rid of (reaching X accuracy or smacking something once in GW2’s case).

Staff Fire 4 - Burning Retreat

Backflip that leaves a burning field that damages, burns and acts as a combo field.

Active mitigation is good as it fits the squishy mage archetype Ele has going on. There is also a point to be made about risk vs. reward in using this for damage vs. using it as a dodge. But the fact that it’s kinda janky and using an escape on an enemy that’s not actively engaging you / hitting someone else feels weird. Compare this to FFXIV Red Mage, which has Displacement (backflip w/ 1 instance of damage) & Engagement (same damage as Displacement, does NOT backflip), which both share charges. There’s still risk involved in using it and running into a situation where you need to disengage, but there’s no situation where you’re running away only to walk back in range again to continue DPSing. That is a fundamental difference in combat (FFXIV having all abilities available at all times, GW2 having a CD between certain “sets”) but the point still stands.

Staff Fire 5 - Meteor Shower

Big area, long range, long cast time. Think old GP ult where each ball does damage but you could conceivably get lucky and dodge all by sheer luck. Each hit reduces the damage of the next by 10% (not multiplicative), down to a minimum of 10%.

The first 3 points are good. It should cover a large area, it should be long range (staff) and it should have a long cast time for a powerful spell, both in damage and coverage. It was pulsing damaging field with an ICD / tick rate but was changed to this monstrosity for some reason. Adding randomness to the big cooldown spell makes it feel awful to use because of how unreliable it is. Even if you do land the hits, it will be miserable to see a meteor smack someone in the face and it does like 100 damage. If it was too strong they should’ve adjusted the damage, not making it both random and sucky when it does land.

Staff Water 1 - Water Blast

Targeted projectile AoE. Enemy is damaged, allies around it get healed.

Simple as expected from a 1 skill. Fits the purpose of Water which is support. Still has the clunky targeted ranged aspect. Not useful for DPS since damage and healing are separate stats. Could have included CC or some debuff that would interact with DPS to make it less horrible to use, like Hammer (will discuss later).

Staff Water 2 - Ice Spike

The only damaging ability in Water. Delayed ground targeted nuke which debuffs enemies for more damage & blasts combo fields.

Probably the best overall ability for staff Water. It damages so it’s usable by DPS, it debuffs so it fills the support role and it blasts combos which is versatile since blasting water fields = healing, but blasting a fire field = Might boon for allies, etc.

Staff Water 3 - Geyser

Ground targeted healing AoE w/ Water combo field.

Pure support ability. Not inherently a bad thing if the overall skill set is balanced between offense and defense but that’s not the case for staff Water. It’s a small field with a big cooldown due to a talent affecting it (where it also revives) so there’s some risk in using it, not being able to revive someone because you were healing.

Staff Water 4 - Frozen Ground

Ground targeted AoE Ice combo field. Enemies Chilled and allies given Frost Aura.

Until very recently, it was just the ice field + chill, you could tell how much stock was put into combo fields. The addition of the Frost Aura is welcome but the Ice Field & Chill aren’t that useful in PvE for Ele. Auras have no base effect if you’re not hit, and Chill isn’t all that impactful other than the slow and the defiance bar (CC) depletion. Ele has no talents that affect Chill like Reaper (Necromancer) does, where they do more damage against Chilled targets.

Staff Water 5 - Healing Rain

Big AoE Water combo field. Regening, cleansing & healing per cleanse.

Big support ability on a big cooldown. Used to not have the heal on cleanse so it was just regen & cleansing + a water field; same note above about combo field value. It’s fine for all of this ability's power budget being spent on support / utility, but the fact that there’s only 1 damaging ability in Water means there’s almost no reason to get into Water as DPS. If 3 or 4 (or both) was more DPS oriented and 1 also hit in an AoE on enemies (targeting in action combat games is a bit wonky sometimes, issues hitting the correct enemy) it would be a lot better.

Staff Air 1 - Chain Lightning

Bouncing lightning attack on target. Bounces 3 times and can bounce back to 1st.

The usual bouncing lightning attack. Sort of dumb that the max single target DPS requires a 2nd target; there’s no extra line about the target taking extra damage if it doesn’t bounce.

Staff Air 2 - Lightning Surge

Targeted AoE that also blinds.

Somehow only just now realising that this is the same as Fire Staff 3, but without the burn. Same notes apply.

Staff Air 3 - Gust

Long range knockback.

Some self peel, but this feels like a PvP balanced ability that’s left there for PvE. The knockback isn’t that strong relative to other CC and that’s all it does. It’s on a big cooldown and the only thing that’s going for it is that it’s long ranged. Doesn’t necessarily need damage, but it could use another effect that goes along with the peeling or CC aspect. Honestly if this skill came out recently I could see it being straight up merged with the next one, with some minor adjustments.

Staff Air 4 - Windborne Speed

AoE movement cleanse & movespeed buffs.

Previously only had the 1 Swiftness (+33% movement speed) boon, recently added 3s of Superspeed (+100% movement speed) onto it. So there’s a quick burst of movement and then the weaker but longer boon too. Would be merged with Staff Air 3 if this was created this decade. Otherwise, can’t add Quickness to it due to the problematic nature of it and Alacrity. Those 2 boons can’t be base kit otherwise you would be able to apply both and cover 2 support roles in 1.

Staff Air 5 - Static Field

Ground targeted AoE lightning combo field. Veigar cage w/ stun on edge.

The only other damaging ability for Staff Air and it does less damage than the auto. Only reiterates the fact that 3 & 4 should be merged and another damaging ability should be added. Ability itself is small but long range and is a good zoning tool but overall means Air is almost exclusively meant for CC only. Meaning dipping out of Fire for damage is more often than not detrimental to DPS.

Staff Earth 1 - Stoning

Single target (!) combo projectile w/ Weakness (-Endurance / Stamina regen, attacks can’t crit and deal 50% damage) debuff.

There’s no reason why auto-attacks deal AoE damage in an action game. It reduces the cases of janky targeting and wouldn’t be detrimental in PvP since most people aren’t stacking right on top of each other, except in WvW but if you’re in range of that many people you’re probably gone anyway since it’s mostly zergs. It’s guaranteed to act as a projectile for combos but those effects aren’t that useful. Honestly the only useful combo are the boon ones since they actually last for a while. Weakness debuff is only half useful in PvE for the damage reduction but it’s not powerful enough to camp Earth for it.

Staff Earth 2 - Eruption

Delayed ground targeted AoE w/ Bleed, Cripple (slow) & combo blast.

A good overall skill. Delay means you can cast it & put down a field afterwards to blast it for some actual decent combo effects. There is a long cast time though which takes some getting used to since it doesn’t feel like something that would require a channel (in fact you can move during that time).


Staff Earth 3 - Magnetic Aura & Transmute Earth

Self buff w/ Magnetic Aura, reflecting all projectiles for 4s. Turns into Transmute Earth while you have a Magnetic Aura, letting you deal PBAoE damage, granting Stability (hard CC immunity stacks) to allies & blasting combos.

Magnetic Aura has a 30s cooldown for some reason, and it only affects yourself. Would be understandable if it also affected allies & gave them Protection (damage reduction) or some other effect. Right now it’s just a single aura which is somewhat insulting to be 30s and take up an ability slot (which you don’t choose). Transmute Earth was added 6 years into the game, so Magnetic Aura was infinitely worse before then. It makes the overall ability a lot less crap and provides some utility (damage is minimal). It has 3x the cooldown in PvE for some reason, as if to prevent it from being used twice since no one is going to camp Earth for > 10s.

Staff Earth 4 - Unsteady Ground

Creates a line that enemies can’t cross (they’ll be knocked back).

It’s a pretty barebones ability. There’s no damage, no DoT and it barely counts as a “defensive” ability for the Earth theme (it’s the same thing as saying damage is CC since enemies can’t hurt you if they’re dead). Previously damaged and Crippled enemies that move through it. Needs an initial effect when placed like deals X damage and puts a Bleed on them or something. 30s CD too.

Staff Earth 5 - Shock Wave

Targeted combo projectile that damages, Bleeds and Immobilizes (roots) all hit (piercing up to 5).

Good skill: damages, DoTs and CCs. No real complaints other than the 25s CD, meaning you’re encouraged to dump CDs and go to the next element but that’s not too feasible since there are some real crappy skills in some of the other attunements (cough Water & Air).
