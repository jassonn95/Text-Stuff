Guild Wars 2 Notes
General
Good combat, mixture of action and tab targeting.
Targeting sometimes gets annoying when mobs surround / get behind you. Skills won’t fire until you manually face them which is fine for the action combat skills, very annoying for the enemy targeted ones. Something like FFXIV’s legacy camera movement would work wonders and make the targeting feel less clunky.
Has stamina + dodging, no active blocking. Most abilities are ground targeted or enemy targeted w/ tab targeting.
No trinity, but the most efficient way to play for endgame stuff is with pseudo trinity anyway (tank / kiter, healer, DPS, support = buff & healer / DPS hybrid).
Quickness + Alacrity buffs shape the meta. Do not like these buffs as it feels awful not to have them, whereas no Might (+Damage) or Fury (+Crit chance) don’t feel nearly as bad when you don’t have them. This differs from Heroism / Bloodlust from WoW because they have a 100% uptime (optimally) whereas in WoW it’s on a CD.
Wiki integration is great, and would be perfect if there was an in-game client rather than having to open it in a browser.
Again, spoilt by FFXIV with having all classes on 1 character, really miss that since I end up creating either 1 character but cloning it for other classes (GW2), using almost default presets for the non main classes (BDO) or just not having more than 1 class (WoW).
Feels like this is just so they can get you to pay for character slots.
Can’t have every crafting profession on the same character, forced to have multiple characters for that.
There is sort of a shared levelling system post level 80, but they’re for utilities rather than combat stuff (auto-loot which should’ve been basekit, special crafting, mount skills, etc).
Awful microtransactions, lots of FOMO. Should strictly be for cosmetics and not convenience. Even more insulting is that equipment & skill loadouts are both separate and character bound, so if you play more than 1 character it’s absolutely overpriced.
Loot. Boxes.
Being able to buy currency in exchange for in-game currency is bad. The effects aren’t too awful as the game has horizontal progression that’s somewhat easy to reach the highest level but still, being able to buy progression (via gear, materials, etc) is dumb.
People often laud the fact that it’s horizontal progression and they feel like they don’t need to grind anything on a gear cycle, but end up permanently grinding for gold to achieve anything. Sometimes I feel bad that I’m not grinding the most profitable content for gold.
That being said, there are a lot of open world events that are both profitable and fun. It’s just when it becomes a grind that sucks out the enjoyment of it.
Little instanced content that I feel like I could quickly jump into, both because there’s very few and the party finder is absolute trash.
Global trading post is great, except when the gold barons are able to manipulate it.
Inventory management is annoying, junk being dropped by everything taking up space and since you have to pay for gear sets your gear will be sitting in the inventory too. Also filled with random items that have very specific uses like teleporters & keys, etc.
Way too many currencies & keys & materials.
Imagine paying 500g to unlock basic party leadership functionality.
Mounts are great, but some are redundant (Springer vs. Skyscale, Skimmer vs. Skiff).
UI needs more customisation, currently only size & where minimap is.
Buff bar is awful, a tiny row of icons that doesn’t seem to have any priority. This excludes boons (positive buffs) and conditions (negative buffs) which are common across all classes; these have their own row.
Skill tooltips are nice and detailed, they also have easy to understand icons.
Infusion stacking is the worst visual design I’ve seen in my life in a game. Not being able to turn it off / hide those players is just as awful.
There is so much visual clutter when doing large meta events. This is allegedly being fixed in June w/ a filter, 10+ years after launch.
Way too much RNG in everything: loot boxes, random skin unlocks, microtransactions (can’t even choose what skin you want for mounts most of the time), gear, mob drops, even enemy prefix augments like in PoE (ones that require you to stay melee / ranged on a boss that teleports randomly, great design), etc.
Balance split between PvE & PvP took years but eventually happened, meaning some skills that are useless are now less useless in their respective modes (separate numbers, slightly different effects, etc).
There is underwater combat with its own set of weapons & abilities, but it’s not that great. Not awful but not really part of the game at all, so won’t include it here at all.
There’s also a couple of skills when you’re downed / drowning (downed underwater). Won’t be including those either as they’re mostly damage / helping you survive long enough to get saved.
Combos are an interesting mechanic but they’ve pretty much been unchanged since release. Their importance and effectiveness have gone down while new classes, specialisations, weapons + skills have made them even more irrelevant. Why bother comboing for boons when another class can press a couple of buttons for permanent buff uptime.
Every interaction being bound to F is very annoying.
Elementalist
Elementalist Combat
Love the concept, execution could be better.
Swap between 4 elements: fire, water, air & earth.
Fire is designed to have heavy damage & burning (DoT).
Water is designed to have support (utility) & healing.
Air is designed to have heavy damage & CC.
Earth is designed to have DoTs & defense.
Each element has its own set of weapon skills.
Utility skills are the same but some change depending on current element (glyph).
In exchange for 4 elements, Ele’s cannot swap weapons in combat.
Most of the time, the best way to play the class is to stick to 2 elements, meaning half the kit is ignored.
This coupled with the fact that it was originally designed to have more but slightly less impactful / specific skills makes it feel bad to ignore half the kit.
The only builds that go through all elements are Weaver (with Weave Self) and hammer Catalyst (with Grand Finale).
The fact that you can’t swap weapons in combat means that you’re sometimes useless when forced to be ranged if you’re using a melee weapon. This can be countered with fight knowledge / using ranged weapons / Conjures / sitting on your thumb.
Absolutely hate that Ele has very little HP and very little armour; they effectively have half the effective health of Warrior.
This is meant to be balanced by the fact that Ele has more active defense (shields, immunities) but they’ve all been nerfed / changed leaving a wet piece of tissue paper.
Understand that PvP is balanced around this, no reason for this to be the case in PvE.
Conjures are awful. Imagine having to pick up (F) a weapon. Completely replaces your weapon bar and (for DPS purposes) you’re encouraged to use the biggest damaging abilities then drop it. Damage is totally gimped if some random person takes your other weapon or it despawns because you have to go through a dumb pick up animation.
Power budget includes access to a lot of combo fields. The importance of combos has changed over the years so how much of the power budget it takes up should be adjusted (there are much easier ways to get boons these days).
Auras are also meant to be a prominent feature for Eles but they haven’t really been changed since release either. They last for very little time and are unaffected by boon duration stats, so their effects while decently strong are rarely felt, especially since it requires you to get hit.
Elementalist Abilities
Staff
Long range AoEs, being pushed to be more support oriented.

Staff Fire 1 - Fireball
Targeted projectile AoE for damage & Burn (only PvE, will only be doing PvE version).

All “1” abilities are the auto-attack so they’re going to be somewhat basic. Fits with the main theme of Fire which is direct damage and DoTs. Also fits the theme of a staff being ranged and slow. Won’t be mentioning if it fits the theme for other abilities, will only mention it if it doesn’t. Feels clunky with the cast time & it being a targeted skill in a mostly action combat game. Especially annoying since your character won’t turn to face and cast if they’re behind you.

Staff Fire 2 - Lava Font
Ground targeted AoE field for damage & Burn. Fire field for combos.

Simple ground targeted AoE for damage. It’s quick and has a low cooldown so not as heavily punished if things move out of it, which it will since its size is pretty small. Combo field lasts for 4s so there’s some time to get some combos off. 

Staff Fire 3 - Flame Burst
Targeted AoE damage, Burn & Blind.

Simple AoE around the target enemy. Same annoyances about enemy targeted skills apply. Blind is also an annoying condition because of how detrimental or useless it is. It completely negates the next singular outgoing attack. This makes it either extremely effective against slower classes or borderline useless against persistent DPS / AoE classes. Should be made more standardised by either making all attacks miss for a far lower duration or make it so it forces the affected to break targeting and darken the screen. The latter may be annoying as CC affecting the player (as in the person playing) isn’t that great by design; it’s annoying, frustrating and could be worked around by putting gamma up to a 100 or something. Blindness has the same issue as the old dodge stats from LoL, WoW and FFXIV where it’s frustrating when it happens and is a minor inconvenience to get rid of (reaching X accuracy or smacking something once in GW2’s case).

Staff Fire 4 - Burning Retreat
Backflip that leaves a burning field that damages, Burn and acts as a combo field.

Active mitigation is good as it fits the squishy mage archetype Ele has going on. There is also a point to be made about risk vs. reward in using this for damage vs. using it as a dodge. But the fact that it’s kinda janky and using an escape on an enemy that’s not actively engaging you / hitting someone else feels weird. Compare this to FFXIV Red Mage, which has Displacement (backflip w/ 1 instance of damage) & Engagement (same damage as Displacement, does NOT backflip), which both share charges. There’s still risk involved in using it and running into a situation where you need to disengage, but there’s no situation where you’re running away only to walk back in range again to continue DPSing. That is a fundamental difference in combat (FFXIV having all abilities available at all times, GW2 having a CD between certain “sets”) but the point still stands.

Staff Fire 5 - Meteor Shower
Big area, long range, long cast time. Think old GP ult where each ball does damage but you could conceivably get lucky and dodge all by sheer luck. Each hit reduces the damage of the next by 10% (not multiplicative), down to a minimum of 10%.

The first 3 points are good. It should cover a large area, it should be long range (staff) and it should have a long cast time for a powerful spell, both in damage and coverage. It was pulsing damaging field with an ICD / tick rate but was changed to this monstrosity for some reason. Adding randomness to the big cooldown spell makes it feel awful to use because of how unreliable it is. Even if you do land the hits, it will be miserable to see a meteor smack someone in the face and it does like 100 damage. If it was too strong they should’ve adjusted the damage, not making it both random and sucky when it does land.

Staff Water 1 - Water Blast
Targeted projectile AoE. Enemy is damaged, allies around it get healed.

Simple as expected from a 1 skill. Fits the purpose of Water which is support. Still has the clunky targeted ranged aspect. Not useful for DPS since damage and healing are separate stats. Could have included CC or some debuff that would interact with DPS to make it less horrible to use, like Hammer (will discuss later).

Staff Water 2 - Ice Spike
The only damaging ability in Water. Delayed ground targeted nuke which debuffs enemies for more damage & blasts combo fields.

Probably the best overall ability for staff Water. It damages so it’s usable by DPS, it debuffs so it fills the support role and it blasts combos which is versatile since blasting water fields = healing, but blasting a fire field = Might boon for allies, etc.

Staff Water 3 - Geyser
Ground targeted healing AoE w/ Water combo field.

Pure support ability. Not inherently a bad thing if the overall skill set is balanced between offense and defense but that’s not the case for staff Water. It’s a small field with a big cooldown due to a talent affecting it (where it also revives) so there’s some risk in using it, not being able to revive someone because you were healing.

Staff Water 4 - Frozen Ground
Ground targeted AoE Ice combo field. Enemies Chilled and allies given Frost Aura.

Until very recently, it was just the ice field + chill, you could tell how much stock was put into combo fields. The addition of the Frost Aura is welcome but the Ice Field & Chill aren’t that useful in PvE for Ele. Auras have no base effect if you’re not hit, and Chill isn’t all that impactful other than the slow and the defiance bar (CC) depletion. Ele has no talents that affect Chill like Reaper (Necromancer) does, where they do more damage against Chilled targets.

Staff Water 5 - Healing Rain
Big AoE Water combo field. Regening, cleansing & healing per cleanse.

Big support ability on a big cooldown. Used to not have the heal on cleanse so it was just regen & cleansing + a water field; same note above about combo field value. It’s fine for all of this ability's power budget being spent on support / utility, but the fact that there’s only 1 damaging ability in Water means there’s almost no reason to get into Water as DPS. If 3 or 4 (or both) was more DPS oriented and 1 also hit in an AoE on enemies (targeting in action combat games is a bit wonky sometimes, issues hitting the correct enemy) it would be a lot better.

Staff Air 1 - Chain Lightning
Bouncing lightning attack on target. Bounces 3 times and can bounce back to 1st.

The usual bouncing lightning attack. Sort of dumb that the max single target DPS requires a 2nd target; there’s no extra line about the target taking extra damage if it doesn’t bounce.

Staff Air 2 - Lightning Surge
Targeted AoE that also blinds.

Somehow only just now realising that this is the same as Fire Staff 3, but without the burn. Same notes apply.

Staff Air 3 - Gust
Long range knockback.

Some self peel, but this feels like a PvP balanced ability that’s left there for PvE. The knockback isn’t that strong relative to other CC and that’s all it does. It’s on a big cooldown and the only thing that’s going for it is that it’s long ranged. Doesn’t necessarily need damage, but it could use another effect that goes along with the peeling or CC aspect. Honestly if this skill came out recently I could see it being straight up merged with the next one, with some minor adjustments.

Staff Air 4 - Windborne Speed
AoE movement cleanse & movespeed buffs.

Previously only had the 1 Swiftness (+33% movement speed) boon, recently added 3s of Superspeed (+100% movement speed) onto it. So there’s a quick burst of movement and then the weaker but longer boon too. Would be merged with Staff Air 3 if this was created this decade. Otherwise, can’t add Quickness to it due to the problematic nature of it and Alacrity. Those 2 boons can’t be base kit otherwise you would be able to apply both and cover 2 support roles in 1.

Staff Air 5 - Static Field
Ground targeted AoE lightning combo field. Veigar cage w/ stun on edge.

The only other damaging ability for Staff Air and it does less damage than the auto. Only reiterates the fact that 3 & 4 should be merged and another damaging ability should be added. Ability itself is small but long range and is a good zoning tool but overall means Air is almost exclusively meant for CC only. Meaning dipping out of Fire for damage is more often than not detrimental to DPS.

Staff Earth 1 - Stoning
Single target (!) combo projectile w/ Weakness (-Endurance / Stamina regen, attacks can’t crit and deal 50% damage) debuff.

There’s no reason why auto-attacks deal AoE damage in an action game. It reduces the cases of janky targeting and wouldn’t be detrimental in PvP since most people aren’t stacking right on top of each other, except in WvW but if you’re in range of that many people you’re probably gone anyway since it’s mostly zergs. It’s guaranteed to act as a projectile for combos but those effects aren’t that useful. Honestly the only useful combo are the boon ones since they actually last for a while. Weakness debuff is only half useful in PvE for the damage reduction but it’s not powerful enough to camp Earth for it.

Staff Earth 2 - Eruption
Delayed ground targeted AoE w/ Bleed, Cripple (slow) & combo blast.

A good overall skill. Delay means you can cast it & put down a field afterwards to blast it for some actual decent combo effects. There is a long cast time though which takes some getting used to since it doesn’t feel like something that would require a channel (in fact you can move during that time).


Staff Earth 3 - Magnetic Aura & Transmute Earth
Self buff w/ Magnetic Aura, reflecting all projectiles for 4s. Turns into Transmute Earth while you have a Magnetic Aura, letting you deal PBAoE damage, granting Stability (hard CC immunity stacks) to allies & blasting combos.

Magnetic Aura has a 30s cooldown for some reason, and it only affects yourself. Would be understandable if it also affected allies & gave them Protection (damage reduction) or some other effect. Right now it’s just a single aura which is somewhat insulting to be 30s and take up an ability slot (which you don’t choose). Transmute Earth was added 6 years into the game, so Magnetic Aura was infinitely worse before then. It makes the overall ability a lot less crap and provides some utility (damage is minimal). It has 3x the cooldown in PvE for some reason, as if to prevent it from being used twice since no one is going to camp Earth for > 10s. Could also have a Bleed effect to contribute to the Earth theme.

Staff Earth 4 - Unsteady Ground
Creates a line that enemies can’t cross (they’ll be knocked back).

It’s a pretty barebones ability. There’s no damage, no DoT and it barely counts as a “defensive” ability for the Earth theme (it’s the same thing as saying damage is CC since enemies can’t hurt you if they’re dead). Previously damaged and Crippled enemies that move through it. Needs an initial effect when placed like deals X damage and puts a Bleed on them or something. 30s CD too.

Staff Earth 5 - Shock Wave
Targeted combo projectile that damages, Bleeds and Immobilizes (roots) all hit (piercing up to 5).

Good skill: damages, DoTs and CCs. No real complaints other than the 25s CD, meaning you’re encouraged to dump CDs and go to the next element but that’s not too feasible since there are some real crappy skills in some of the other Attunements (cough Water & Air).

Scepter
Mid-long range, damage & control.

Scepter Fire 1 - Flamestrike
Targeted AoE 2 part attack. 1st is targeted, 2nd is wherever the 1st was after a brief delay. Both damage & Burn.

The usual ranged targeted attack, w/ the 2nd part delay twist. This gives it a bit of counterplay in PvP and a lot of grief in PvE if the mobs move out of it.

Scepter Fire 2 - Dragon’s Tooth
Targeted delayed AoE. Damages, Burns & blasts.

Originally targeted, then became ground casted, meaning it would miss. A lot. Being changed to targeted means more reliability = more damage & less frustration. It doing good damage & blasting combos fits the animation.

Scepter Fire 3 - Phoenix
Ground targeted piercing attack that damages & Burns before exploding for more damage & Blasting combos. It returns again doing more passthrough damage & Burn while cleansing self & providing Vigor (stamina regen).

Good overall ability, with somewhat random utility attached to it that’s normally reserved for Water. Damage requires aiming both directional and ground targeted so it’s not exactly the same as Scepter Fire 2. Utility is nice but again, would be better suited to Water or Earth even.

Scepter Water 1 - Ice Shards
Single target attack w/ 3 instances of the same damage. No other effect, but should be a chance combo projectile like Scepter Earth 1.

Bit annoying with the targeted single target attack. Otherwise somewhat boring as it has no other effects. It’s almost identical to Scepter Earth 1 but without the bleed (understandable) and without the combo projectile chance. It having 3 instances of damage makes it less likely to be screwed over by crit RNG, if it wasn’t for the fact that power DPS builds build around having 100% crit.

Scepter Water 2 - Shatterstone
Ground targeted delayed AoE that damages & Chills.

The usual ground targeted AoE ability. Used to apply Vulnerability (increased damage taken) but was replaced with Chill, specifically for the next ability. Slight delay means there’s some counterplay but not that important in PvE. Low cooldown so can be spammed, who doesn’t love exploding ice everywhere?

Scepter Water 3 - Water Trident
Multitarget (3) attack. Damages & heals you per target hit (up to double base amount w/ 3 hits). Damage increased against Chilled targets (+50%). 2 charges.

Great ability imo. Homes in on nearby enemies so doesn’t require enemies to be on top of each other. Damage synergy with previous ability w/ Chill conditional, but not at an absurd level like 100%. Heals for some sustain without going too crazy in single target vs. AoE situations. Charge based so you’re not punished for holding onto a charge to heal, acts as another pseudo active mitigation / recovery tool that Eles need for their awful survivability. You can definitely tell this was recently revamped (was ground targeted damage enemy heal allies AoE, no charges, no Chill damage modifier).

Scepter Air 1 - Arc Lightning
Channelled multitarget beam attack. Damage is backloaded.

Encourages you to keep an eye on the attack channel for max value as the last 4 tickets deal 4x the first portion and 2x the 2nd portion. Even though it’s a beam attack it still hits more than 1 target, unlike someone else.

Scepter Air 2 - Lightning Strike
Multitarget damage & Vulnerability. No cast time (doesn’t interrupt channels).

Synergies with Scepter Air 1 since you can keep channelling and also use this ability to damage and debuff the enemy. Previously it was just damage and ONLY on the primary target, modernising it with some utility and AoE.

Scepter Air 3 - Blinding Flash
Multitarget Blind & Weakness. 2 charges, no cast time.

Same notes about Blind & Weakness as before.
Same notes about no cast time as above.
2 charges allow some flexibility in the skill, either layering it on the same target or spreading it out.

Scepter Earth 1 - Stone Shards
Single target attack w/ 3 instances of the same damage & Bleeds. 20% chance each hit is a combo projectile.

This is almost exactly the same as Scepter Water 1, except it bleeds and can act as a combo projectile. Doesn’t seem to be a good reason it isn’t. Adding more RNG to the combat isn’t the greatest, especially if it’s for a mediocre effect. But do agree that 100% chance might be a bit too strong. Otherwise, the same notes apply.

Scepter Earth 2 - Rock Barrier & Hurl
Self HP shield, Toughness (stat) buff & Resistance (ignore non-damaging conditions) boon. Gives access to Hurl, consuming the Toughness buff & shooting 5x projectiles for 5 instances of damage, Bleeding and combo projectile.

Originally only had the Toughness buff, so you know it’s bad if you had to triple the amount of effects an ability has. All 3 effects contribute to survivability, as dictated by the Earth theme. Hurl presents some risk vs. reward in consuming the defensive buff for damage, though it’s generally not a life or death situation in PvE. Piercing would be preferred so it’s less reliant on tab targeting in an action combat game.

Scepter Earth 3 - Dust Devil
Ground targeted AoE. Damages & Cripples Bleeding enemies 3x. 1st hit blinds.

Small field that does a bit of damage & some conditional CC. Not particularly the best skill around but it’s somewhat better than what it was before. Previously just did 1 instance of damage at target & AoE around them. Pulsing damage & CC is more flexible. There’s synergy with the other Earth skills w/ bleeding but the effect isn’t strong enough to warrant it being conditional CC. Could’ve been basekit Cripple but additional damage & Bleed if already Bleeding.

Dagger
Short range & fast. Note that Dagger is main hand (1, 2, 3) & off hand (4, 5). Meaning you can mix and match and not necessarily have to take all 5 (or 20) Dagger skills at once.

Dagger Fire 1 - Dragon’s Claw
Short range piercing shotgun.

Dagger is for short ranged (not quite melee) combat and this is a good example of it. Rewarded for getting up close when you manage to land all 3 shots on a target. Piercing to make it feel not horrible in AoE situations.

Dagger Fire 2 - Drake’s Breath
Channelled frontal cone; can move. Damages & Burns.

Same premise as the above. Channelled makes it even riskier since it’s close ranged, but does big damage especially for DoT builds.

Dagger Fire 3 - Burning Speed
Slide forward & damage in an AoE at the end. Leave behind a fire combo field that damages and Burns. Has an Evade (dodge) component.

Interesting skill that could be better. Evade component gives it skill expression, but there’s a 0.75s cast time so it’s pretty hard to pull off the dodge on higher ping. Recently it was changed to stop at the target. This means the fire field won’t ever hit the enemy if you have 1 targeted, which you should since it auto-targets if you don’t have 1 and you use an ability. Fire field should also happen at the end point. Other than that it’s a pretty good skill. Could possibly argue that it should also have a Combo Leap component but the skill is somewhat overloaded as is. Maybe only in PvE since Leap isn’t as impactful there as it is in PvP.

Dagger Fire 4 - Ring of Fire
PBAoE fire combo field. Damages, Burns on cast & Burns on passthrough.

Just a fire combo field that spawns underneath you. Short ranged, matching weapon. Combo field matching Eles “strengths”. Fire because, well, Fire Attunement.

Dagger Fire 5 - Fire Grab
Short ranged frontal cone. Damages, +60% if they’re burning.

Simple ability that synergises w/ the rest of the weapon / Attunement. Same notes about being short ranged apply.

Dagger Water 1 - Vapor Blade
Mid range piercing boomerang, damages & applies Vulnerability.

Pretty cool ability. Damage & debuff aren’t enough to warrant sticking around and using it though, making it a mediocre filler. Could have a heal attached to it to make it more attractive to the support side or apply more / longer Vulnerability stacks.

Dagger Water 2 - Cone of Cold
Healing version of the fire breath. 0.25x the damage and 2x the cooldown but gets a heal on it instead!

Pretty much just the healing fire breath. The exchange for the heal does seem pretty bad but player health pools compared to the enemy is a big difference. Only issue I have is that targeting is weird when you have a beneficial + damaging ability in 1. The game will auto-target the enemy and focus the breath on them, but you’ll probably try and move to position the breath to hit your allies which it won’t do because it’s still aiming at the enemy. Can de-target or position so allies are in between but doesn’t that make it any less janky in general.

Dagger Water 3 - Frozen Burst
PBAoE combo blast. Damages & Chills.

Damage is pretty weak and Chill isn’t more useful for Ele than other classes like it is for Reaper (Necromancer). Only real useful part is the Blast combo component for Aoe boons / auras / conditions / healing / cleanse, etc depending on the combo field.


Dagger Water 4 - Frost Aura & Transmute Frost
Self buff w/ Frost Aura, reducing damage taken by 10% & Chilling enemies that hit for 2s (1s ICD per attacker). Turns into Transmute Frost when affected by a Frost Aura, letting you deal PBAoE damage, heal & Regen.

Exact same comments as Magnetic Aura & Transmute Frost. This at least only has a 10s cooldown vs. 30s but its effect still should be AoE by default (there’s a talent which I’ll go into later). Transmute Frost also shouldn’t be on a 10s CD compared to PvP where it’s 3s. Other than that, its effects are what you expect from the Water version. It could maybe use 1 more offensive effect like Vulnerability or Chill or something. 

Dagger Water 5 - Cleansing Wave
PBAoE heal & cleanse.

Pretty simple ability; does what it says and fits Water theme & dagger constraints.

Dagger Air 1 - Lightning Whip
2x frontal attack, small cleave.

Simple ability since it’s a 1 skill. Borderline melee lightning attack; ticks the boxes.

Dagger Air 2 - Convergence
Delayed PBAoE. Damages, applies Weakness & grants Fury per enemy struck.

Used to be a frontal cone w/ the same effects, the delayed PBAoE makes it more interesting as you can prepare it. It’s also just more unique rather than having another frontal cone (yes it’s a PBAoE, but it’s delayed). Same notes about Weakness apply (stam regen penalty not that useful in PvE, damage reduction not reliable either). Fury is handy but in group content the healer / support will have it covered. Solo it’s useful because of the “per enemy struck” clause, making it last long enough to be useful.


Dagger Air 3 - Shocking Aura & Transmute Lightning
Self buff w/ Shocking Aura, stunning enemies that attack you for 1s (2s ICD per attacker). Turns into Transmute Lightning when affected by a Shocking Aura, letting you deal PBAoE damage & Stun.

Same comments as Magnetic Aura & Frost Aura. Also 10s but this is definitely a PvP skill as a 1s stun won’t really help if you get downed in like 5 hits as a squishy Ele. Could increase the stun duration or also apply Weakness to help survive. Transmute Lightning also should be a 3s CD. It could also have an additional effect like applying Swiftness because right now it’s just some damage and a stun.

Dagger Air 4 - Ride the Lightning
Gapcloser w/ PBAoE damage if it hits an enemy. Half cooldown if it does hit.

Simple gapcloser. Can be used as part of your damage rotation at the cost of some mobility. Auto-targeting may cause issues, launching you in unexpected directions.

Dagger Air 5 - Updraft
Evading short backflip w/ Swiftness & delayed CC.

Defensive dodge w/ CC attached. Use for CC or hold as an extra Evade, so there’s some risk involved. CC was changed to be delayed because of PvP, could’ve kept it separate. Even a little bit of damage would make sense on it since you’re launching a bunch of enemies into the air.

Dagger Earth 1 - Impale
Single target damage & Bleed.

No reason for this to be single target, especially since it’s very short ranged. Damages & Bleeds like every other Earth ability.

Dagger Earth 2 - Ring of Earth
2x PBAoE damage, Bleed & Cripple. Blocks projectiles.

Pretty cool animation, launching self into air and then crashing down into the earth. Damage & condition effects make sense w/ animation & theme. Extra skill expression w/ projectile blocking but that’s more of a PvP thing.

Dagger Earth 3 - Earthen Rush
Earth version of the Fire dash. Damages, Immobilizes (roots) enemies while Evading & combo Leaping.

Pretty much the same notes as Burning Speed. Has the Evade too but this one has 0.5s cast time as opposed to 0.75s for some reason. Also was made to stop at the enemy if targeted, meaning it won’t be hit by the trail of spikes behind. Acts as a Leap combo but since there are no Combo fields in Earth you’ll have to use one from another weapon / Attunement.

Dagger Earth 4 - Earthquake
PBAoE stomp that damages, knocks down and Blasts combos.

Very good damage and CC as well as Blasting combos. The only issue is that it’s VERY easy to cancel for some reason compared to other abilities with cast times. Cancelling with dodging makes sense but it’s also cancellable with a movement input, which honestly should be buffered. Should only be cancellable via dodging or sheathing w/ Z or pressing Esc.

Dagger Earth 5 - Churning Earth
Long cast PBAoE Cripple (slow) which explodes for Damage, Bleeding & Blasts combos.

Risk vs. reward since it has a long channel time where you’re vulnerable to CC & damage but the pay off is in big damage and to a lesser degree a combo Blast. It’s also VERY easy to cancel with movement input. Can also be comboed with Lightning Flash (utility blink, discussed below) to reposition the PBAoE without cancelling it, a nifty little combo.

Focus
Defense oriented. Off-hand only.

Focus Fire 4 - Flamewall
Ground targeted Fire combo field that damages & Burns.

Fire combo field that can be placed at range, making it versatile. Other than that it’s just like every other Fire combo field.

Focus Fire 5 - Fire Shield & Transmute Fire
Self buff w/ Fire Aura, burning enemies that attack & granting Might each time (1s ICD per attacker). Turns into Transmute Fire when affected by a Fire Aura, damaging & Burning enemies while granting allies Might.

Same note about aura application not being AoE. Same not about the Transmute not also being 3s in PvE. Skill itself is fine with its 3 effects, possible combo related effect if they want to lean into that.

Focus Water 4 - Freezing Gust
Single target Chill w/ a bit of damage.

There’s really no reason why this can’t have a small AoE around the target, especially since the chill is 3s and it’s on a 25s CD. Other than that, it needs something else since Chill doesn’t do much and the skill is practically unchanged since the release of the game.

Focus Water 5 - Comet
Targeted, slightly delayed AoE damage & Daze (same as stun, except players can still move whereas mobs can’t so it’s effectively a stun). Also Blasts combos.

A fine CC skill as there’s a bit of a delay so you can avoid it in PvP. Other than that it’s just CC with some damage. Blast is at the centre of the enemy hitbox which isn’t always that great depending on the hitbox.

Focus Air 4 - Swirling Winds
PBAoE area that blocks missiles.

Powerful defensive spell, lasts 6s so there’s enough time to get full value out of it unlike that 1 Earth spell that lasts 2s. Could stand to maybe also increase ally movespeed while in the field for a bit more utility, via a unique buff or Swiftness.

Focus Air 5 - Gale
Single target ranged unblockable knockdown.

Strong for PvP but in PvE it should just also be AoE. Other than that, it’s a dedicated CC spell on a huge cooldown which also should be reduced in PvE only.

Focus Earth 4 - Magnetic Wave
PBAoE damage & Cripple while also cleansing 3 Conditions & 3s projectile reflection. Also Blasts combos.

Strong skill that does a whole bunch of things at once. Only thing that could improve it is if there was some way to include Bleed into it, maybe rocks flying out as shrapnel in the animation just so it works more w/ DoT builds like other Earth skills.

Focus Earth 5 - Obsidian Flesh
3s of invulnerability. Channelled so you can only move.

Nerfed in PvE for no reason. Was formerly both 4s and wasn’t channelled. It’s already on a huge 50s cooldown so there’s already some risk in using it incorrectly, there was no need for it to be made into a channel.

Healing
Choose 1.

Arcane Brilliance - Arcane
PBAoE damage. Base heal, increased w/ per target hit. Blasts combos.

Arcane’s gimmick is that they always do critical damage, not that it matters since builds in PvE all revolve around getting to 100% crit anyway. Since there are only 5 Arcane skills, there’s no build revolved around Arcane to warrant not building crit. 

Skill itself specifically is the most offensive of the heals since it’s the only one that damages and potentially the biggest burst of healing. Tradeoff is that it’s the longest cooldown and is conditional for the amount healed, becoming weaker in single target. Bit of extra utility with the Blast component.

Ether Renewal - Cantrip
Channelled heal & cleanse per pulse. Pulses 8 times.

Cantrips are all defensive spells that activate instantly and this is no different. Does a medium amount of healing but the main reason you choose it is because of the huge cleansing component. The tradeoff is that it’s 2.25s of channelling where you’re both vulnerable and not attacking. In PvE there are better ways of cleansing, reserving this for PvP.

Glyph of Elemental Harmony - Glyph
Medium heal burst + a Boon depending on current Attunement.

Glyphs secondary effects change depending on the current Attunement. In this case, Fire = Might, Water = Regen, Air = Swiftness & Earth = Protection. However these Boons aren’t the main reason to take this heal as they don’t last long enough or they don’t scale that well (Regen won’t do much if you don’t have Healing Power). It’s the biggest non-conditional burst heal out of the base heal skills.

Signet of Restoration - Signet
Passively heal per spell cast (so any weapon skill). 
Active is a low heal burst.

Signets have both passive & active components. Passives are on cooldown while recharging by default, so there’s some downside to using the active if you don’t absolutely need it. This heal has the most passive healing but is the worst in terms of burst healing.

Utility
Choose 3.

Arcane Blast - Arcane
Single target ranged crit nuke. 3 charges. Acts as a combo Projectile.

Decent single target damage, which is what’s advertised. Charges allow holding at least 2 until burst phase if needed, some extra skill layered in. Not that interesting though, especially since it’s a non-Elemental spell for the Elementalist class.

Arcane Power - Arcane
PBAoE buff that guarantees crits on attacks per stack. Also grants Ferocity (crit damage stat) per stack. More stacks for self than allies (4 vs 2).

Absolutely awful since stacks are consumed per hit, meaning a weak attack consuming the stack would completely gimp its effectiveness. Could try and time it but there’s usually a lot going on in terms of attacks going out. Could really be duration based rather than stack based, especially since this is a 45s CD probably because of PvP.

Arcane Shield - Arcane
Block the next 3 attacks. Explodes for crit damage if it blocks all 3. Also breaks stun.

Mostly used to break out of a stun. Same note about stacks vs. duration, at least in PvE. Compared to other defensive Utilities that break stun, it’s more on the defensive side without completely stopping you from attacking.

Arcane Wave - Arcane
AoE version of Arcane Blast. 2 charges. Blasts combos.

Literally just the AoE version of Arcane Blast, except it actually Blasts combos.

Armor of Earth - Cantrip
Break out of stuns, grant self Protection & Stability & Barrier per boon you have.

The other defensive stun break that doesn’t gimp damage. Offers more mitigation rather than blocking the attacks, meaning you could still get downed. The mitigation is standardised at 6s though as opposed to the stacks. Conditional barrier is kind of stupid though. It should have a base amount and then increase per boon. Luckily it grants the Protection & Stability then the barrier in terms of logic so there is a bit of a base value, technically.

Cleansing Fire - Cantrip
Cleanse 5 conditions & Burn enemies in PBAoE. Gain Might per condition cleansed. 2 charges.

An actual good & safe cleansing option without sacrificing too much damage. Charges allow some flexibility, possibly even using it offensively. Might per condition cleansed also rewards cleansing properly but not that useful in group content since you should have max Might anyway. Possibly extra Burn stacks instead.

Lightning Flash - Cantrip
Blink to & damage an area.

No reason why this shouldn’t also act as a stun break in PvE (which was removed 10 years ago). Other than that it’s just kind of boring. Yes you can use it to reposition certain skills but other than that it needs something else other than some pitiful damage, maybe AoE Swiftness & Weakness per enemy hit.

Mist Form - Cantrip
Breaks stun & Invulnerability for 3s. You can move very quickly but cannot attack.

The most defensive of the stun breaks. The trade off is that it’s a huge cooldown of 60s and you cannot attack at all. Can change Attunements during this so there’s some flexibility in that regard. Might also need a healing or cleansing component attached to it (in PvE) to make it stand out because right now it’s strictly a PvP ability.

Conjure Earth Shield - Conjure
Creates an Earth Shield in your hands (replacing weapon skills) & target location. Wielders get Toughness (armour stat) and Vitality (health stat).
a) Shield Smack: Melee damage & Bleeding cleave.
b) Shield Smash: Melee damage & more Bleeding cleave.
c) Crippling Shield: Line boomerang damage & Cripple. Double damage & Bleeding if you have any Barrier.
Stone Sheath: Block next attack within 2.25s & PBAoE damage & Bleed. Gain Barrier if an attack is blocked.
Magnetic Surge: PBAoE damage & Daze and grant self Magnetic Aura.
Magnetic Shield: PBAoE damage & pull. Grant self Barrier & Protection per enemy pulled. Unblockable.
Fortify: Invulnerable but unable to move or attack at all. Can blink with Lightning Flash.

Conjure’s gimmick is that they create a weapon in both your hand and at target location. This differs from Engineer’s Kits where only they get the weapon. It seriously should just act the same because a) having to run up and press F to pick up a weapon is the dumbest thing ever and b) someone stealing your weapon is the most frustrating thing ever. Get rid of the passive stats and the 2nd weapon and make it like Kits.

Onto the actual weapon, it’s the most defensive of the 5 as expected. Works around Barriers & Bleeding which fits the Earth theme of DoTs and defence. Also has CC and pulls to help being a melee weapon. Don’t get much use out of this in PvE and even if it was better in PvE, you’d only use 1 or 2 abilities before dumping it immediately. This can be resolved by it becoming more like Kits, where you can jump into the weapon anytime and use what you need at the time.

Conjure Flame Axe - Conjure
Creates a Flame Axe in your hands & target location. Wielders get Power (direct damage stat) & Condition Damage (DoT damage stat).
a) Lava Axe: Single target ranged damage & Might for self.
b) Double Lava Axe: same as above, but there are 2 projectiles.
Explosive Lava Axe: ground targeted AoE damage & Blast. Grants Fired Up, allowing Double Lava Axe to be used.
Burning Retreat: almost identical to the Staff version. Also grants Fired Up.
Ring of Fire: almost identical to the Dagger version. Also grants Fired Up.
Flame Leap: Combo Leap to enemy, dealing Damage, Burning & Fired Up.

Not a really good look if 2 of the 5 abilities are the same as abilities from other weapons. There’s some auto attack weaving involved w/ Fired Up (doesn’t stack) so there’s some nuance involved. There’s some Burning involved but they don’t last very long. Could use a lot more Burning (possibly via Fired Up buff) to make it a contender for DoT builds because right now, no one ever uses this Utility.

Conjure Frost Bow - Conjure
Creates a Frost Bow in your hands & target location. Wielders get Condition Duration (DoT duration stat) & Healing Power (healing stat).
Water Arrow: Targeted damage & AoE heal. Grants Water Arrow stacks (up to 2, 5s duration).
Frost Volley: Multiple single target attacks. Damages, applies Vulnerability & acts as a Combo Projectile per shot. Damage increased per Water Arrow.
Frost Fan: Ashe W that shotguns and pierces. Damages & Chills. +1 arrow per Water Arrow stack (base 7 arrows).
Frost Storm: Ground targeted AoE. Damages w/ dumb damage reduction per hit & Bleeds. More projectiles per Water Arrow stack (base 24 impacts).
Deep Freeze: Single target damage, Chill & Stun after cast time. +0.5s duration to Stun per Water Arrow stack (base 3s).

More utility & damage based than the usual Water skills. Requires uptime of Water Arrows for max value on skills. Should remove healing from this skill and create a separate Water based Conjure under Healing Utilities, leaving this to be the support / utility option w/ some damage. Other than that the skills synergise with the auto due to the Water Arrow stacks, except for the weird Bleeding on Frost Storm. Could’ve added a “deal X more damage if chilled” clause somewhere too. Same note about the dumb damage reduction on “storm” type abilities, make it pulsing & consistent.

Conjure Lightning Hammer - Conjure
Creates a Lightning Hammer in your hands & target location. Wielders get Ferocity (crit damage) & Precision (crit chance).
a) Lightning Swing: melee cleave.
b) Static Swing: melee cleave.
c) Thunderclap: melee AoE, damaging, Blinding & Blasting combos.
Lightning Leap: Combo leap to target, damaging in an AoE & granting Quickness (skill animations are faster).
Wind Blast: Damage & Launch back a single target. Also grant Superspeed.
Call Lightning: PBAoE damaging strikes w/ damage reduction per hit.
Static Field: Almost identical to the Staff version.

Damage & CC, fitting the Air theme. Same notes about Conjures apply. Melee weapon so skills fit together in keeping up uptime on enemies. Same notes about damage reduction per hit apply. Standardise that. Could do with an actual unique 5th ability, but at least this time there’s only 1 copied ability. Maybe an initial stun around self and then a lightning field that follows. Possibly too strong for PvP but oh well, not like that game mode gets any updates (no I’m not bitter about PvP ruining things for PvE ☺️).

Glyph of Elemental Power - Glyph
Stun break. Gain 5 stacks. Each stack makes your attacks deal increased damage & apply a Condition depending on Attunement when used: 
Fire: Burn | Water: Chill | Air: Vulnerability | Earth: Bleeding

Weird to have a stun break associated with this skill when you want to use it on cooldown. Yes there’s something that could be said about risk vs. reward but it would’ve fit better on Lightning Flash (no I’m not bitter). Used to be duration based rather than stack based, probably because of PvP shenanigans. Overall this ability is just more damage on something you’re already doing (using spells) w/ some consideration on when to use it as the Conditions don’t change after it’s used.

Glyph of Lesser Elementals - Glyph
Summon a weak elemental depending on Attunement: 
Fire: Burns & grants Might | Water: Chills & provides Ice Combo field | Air: is ranged, grants Swiftness & cleanses Cripple, Immobilize or Chill | Earth: applies Weakness, tankier. 
40s CD but lasts for 120s, cap of 5 summons.

Don’t like pets, won’t ever like pets. Unlike other pets though, these despawn on mount which is very annoying. There’s also a case where you need to precast a bunch before a boss fight which is more downtime and variance if you can’t spawn 5 of them in time (using mushrooms / potions or whatever that reset your cooldowns). Pets themselves are weak and apply non-comparable things, like boons vs. a combo field vs. a cleanse vs. being tankier. They should all do their unique things via the same method (boons, conditions, etc).

Glyph of Renewal - Glyph
Ranged res with a cast time. 
Fire: GA effect for 15s on res-ee | Water: full heal on res | Air: res & pull them to your location | Earth: PBAoE res (3).

PvP ability w/ some use in PvE (raid situations). Provides some safety since it’s a ranged res vs. having to run up to someone and press F (which is used for practically everything). Opportunity cost of taking a safe res vs. any of the other utilities.

Glyph of Storms - Glyph
Ground targeted AoE storm. 
Fire: pulsing burning field | Water: projectiles that chill and have that dumb damage reduction per hit | Air: same but vulnerability instead of chill | Earth: pulsing bleeding & blindness field.

First complaint about this is the projectile damage reduction per hit for Water & Air. If the damage was too high, it should’ve been reduced linearly. Second complaint is the varying cooldowns per Attunement. If Air was too strong (which it was, to be fair), reduce the damage, don’t make it ~3x the cooldown of Fire. Finally, they all have differing durations, why? Just standardise them so they’re more comparable and you choose depending on what you need more clearly. Other than that they all do what you expect each Attunement to do, though Water could use more in the support category since Chill is, again, not that good in PvE in general.

Signet of Air - Signet
Passive: movespeed. 
Active: Breaks stun, damage, blind & apply Vulnerability to target & nearby enemies.

Good example of a stun break since you only want to use it in defensive situations (blinding the enemy helps survivability).

Signet of Earth - Signet
Passive: toughness (armour stat). 
Active: Damage, Bleed & Immobilize target.

Other than the Immobilize, this doesn’t really help with tankiness. Possibly needs a Barrier aspect associated with it. Also needs to be AoE. Could keep Immobilize to be a single target only if that’s an issue because of ~PvP~.

Signet of Fire - Signet
Passive: precision (crit chance). 
Active: Damage & Burn target & nearby enemies.

Fine, not too interesting. Used to need it to reach crit cap for Power builds (non-DoT). Now only used in Condition builds because of the huge Burn on a low cooldown.

Signet of Water - Signet
Passive: -20% Condition duration on self. 
Active: Damage & Chill enemies while healing & reviving (not a complete revive) allies around ground targeted area.

The passive isn’t really helpful as you’re still being affected by those Conditions. Also doesn’t really fit w/ the rest of the ability. It’s one of the few Utilities that heal and is really the only reason to take it since the damage is low, Chill isn’t that helpful and the revive is 5% of their downed health bar (reaching 100% = revive). Passive could be changed to be increased healing power or boon duration to fit better.

Elite
Choose 1.

Conjure Fiery Greatsword - Conjure
Creates a Fiery Greatsword in your hands & target location. Target location is also damaged & Burned. Wielders get Power (direct damage stat) & Condition Damage (DoT damage stat). Randomly casts Lesser Fiery Eruption, damaging & Burning in an AoE every 6s.
Flame Wave: Medium ranged piercing projectile that damages.
Fiery Eruption: Medium ranged targeted AoE that only Burns, no direct damage.
Fiery Whirl: Tryndamere E. Damages, Cripples, Evades & Whirls combos.
Fiery Rush: Dash to enemy, damaging & leaving damaging Fire (not field) behind. Ignores movement speed slows. No Burning.
Firestorm: Ground targeted pulsing damage field.

Decent Elite, if not for the fact it’s a 3 minute long cooldown. Target damage & Burn isn’t needed, seems to be there just to fit the animation. Randomly cast abilities are annoying & unreliable. What doesn’t make sense is that it does the same amount of Burning as the activated version, but also does direct damage making it objectively better than an activated ability but is called “Lesser”. Technically has a 1s higher CD but doesn’t require a cast. Auto is fine, could use some Burning interaction since you’re whacking someone with fireballs. Fiery Eruption needs direct damage, it doesn’t make sense otherwise. Fiery Whirl is okay; it does more damage against bigger hitbox enemies which is dumb and should be standardised. Fiery Rush needs to have Burning on it considering it leaves a Fire section behind. Also needs to be a combo field to make it consistent with its animation. Otherwise get rid of the fire wall because it forcibly doesn’t generate if you use it while in a hitbox, meaning stationary enemies are never hit by the fire field. Firestorm just needs some burning, otherwise it being a pulsing field rather than damage reduced projectiles is great.

Glyph of Elementals - Glyph
Summon a better pet. Can be commanded for an extra ability.
Fire: Burns & applies Might. Command for more damage & Burning.
Water: Chills & creates Ice Combo fields. Command for knockback, heal & cleanse.
Air: Ranged, applies Swiftness & cleanses Crippled, Immobilized & Chilled. Command for a stun.
Earth: Tanky, applies Weakness on enemy. Command for Protection for allies & Cripple & Immobilize for enemies around it.

Bigger & better version of Glyph of Lesser Elementals, but you can only have 1 which is much more manageable in terms of balance. Pets are still going to act like pets so if you don’t like pets (like me), you won’t feel good about using it. Take Fire for damage, Water for healing, Air for CC & Earth for something to tank & CC. Also for some reason Water lasts 60s despite the tooltip saying all last 120s.

Tornado - Cantrip
Grant self Stability & turn into a tornado, replacing weapon skills, preventing Heal or Utility skills from being used or changing Attunements. Pulse every 3s for 4 pulses which damages & knocksback. Become a walking Lightning combo field that’s constantly Whirling for automatic Lightning Whirls.
Electrified Tornado: shoot out bouncing lightning, damaging enemies.
Dust Tornado: shoot out dust devils, damaging & blinding enemies.
Debris Tornado: shout out debris, damaging & knocking back enemies.
Elemental Requiem: shoot out random effects, damaging & applying Vulnerability, Bleeding or Cripple.
Dust Charge: Charge forward, damaging & launching enemies.

Honestly one of the worst skills Eles have. Trading everything away for a bunch of nothing. May have once been useful in PvP but the fact that it has a 150s CD (it’s lower in PvP for some reason???) and it takes away your ability to do anything else makes it absolutely garbage. Also where’s the Elemental part of it? It also doesn’t fit the Cantrip theme either since it takes 1 second to activate and only applies Stability or CCs enemies. You’re still vulnerable to damage & CC during all of this.

Traits
Non-coloured Traits are auto picked if the tree is chosen. Coloured Traits are a choice of 1. Can only pick 3 trees.
Fire

Empowering Flame
Grant Power while in Fire.

More damage while in Fire Attunement, fitting its theme. Could also make it give power in general and doubled in Fire to make the other Attunements stronger / less crappy like Power Overwhelming below. Maybe something for Condition builds too, like Condition Damage in addition to Power.

Burning Precision
Increased Burning duration you inflict & crits have a chance to inflict Burn.

More damage for both power & condition builds (less DoT duration stat you need, the more can be put into DoT damage).

Conjurer
Gain Fire Aura when someone picks up your Conjured weapons.

Absolutely garbage in PvE. Requires Conjures to be taken and puts a lot of value into the Fire Aura.It could be interesting to have a theme around Auras if they weren’t some crap by themselves.

Burning Fire
Cast Lesser Cleansing Fire when you have 3 conditions on you.
Lesser Cleansing Fire: Cleanse 3 conditions on self & PBAoE Burn. Gain Might per condition cleansed.

Survivability trait. Strictly for PvP since cleansing 3 conditions every 40s isn’t that useful.

Sunspot
Gain Fire Aura & PBAoE damage when switching to Fire / Overload (Tempest). Cannot crit.

More benefits for switching to Fire. Benefits match the theme, all round fitting trait. Crit modifier was added due to PvP, not sure why it’s in PvE.

Burning Rage
Sunspot inflicts Burning & radius is increased. Condition Damage is increased.

Upgrades Sunspot to be better for Condition builds; take it if you’re building for DoTs.

Smothering Auras
Fire Auras have +33% increased duration. Applying auras removes 1 condition to the recipient. Transmuting Auras removes 2 conditions.

Support choice for this portion. Not too useful in PvE since Conditions are only an issue in PvP.

Power Overwhelming
While >= 10 Might stacks, gain Power. Doubled while in Fire.

More power damage almost all the time in grouped content. Take it if building power.

Pyromancer’s Training
Fire weapon skills (1 - 5) have 20% reduced cooldown. Deal +10% strike (direct, not DoT) damage against Burning enemies.

More cooldown reduction = more abilities = more player agency = more fun! More damage against Burning enemies fits the theme, realistically it’s a flat +10% damage.

Persisting Flames
Fire Fields from weapon skills last 2s longer. Fire Fields grant a stack every time they hit an enemy, up to 10 for +10% strike damage.

Damage up for both DPS builds. Fields lasting longer means more damage + Burning. Stacks obviously mean more power damage.

Pyromancer’s Puissance
Gain Might when using any skill (1 - 5) while attuned to Fire. Leaving Fire or finishing Fire Overload activates Flame Expulsion.
Flame Expulsion: consume Might on self for PBAoE damage, Burning & Might for allies, increased per Might consumed.

Bit of a weird trait / skill. Granting others Might suggests it’s a support ability, but the damage & Burning suggests it’s a DPS ability. Damage & Burning don’t outweigh what you get from Persisting Flames and it also costs you 10 Might. Might granted lasts a decent amount of time though, which makes it lean closer to a support trait. However, it does require going into Fire meaning you’ll miss out on the other trees in exchange for mediocre damage since you’re not building for it or utility that’s not useful in PvE.

Blinding Ashes
Blind enemies that you Burn. 8s ICD per enemy.

PvP option. A blind every 8s isn’t that useful, especially compared to the others.
Air

Zephyr’s Speed
+5% crit chance. +25% movespeed while in Air.

Crit chance added here due to the rework of a problematic set of unique class buffs (Ranger in particular). Fits because if you are speccing Air, you’ll want crit. Movespeed is handy but again, would’ve been nice to have half the effect in the other elements.

Zephyr’s Boon
Grant 5s of Fury & Swiftness to allies you grant Auras to (self included).

Support choice based around Auras; makes them less crap. Crit + movespeed buffs fit the Air theme. Could also add an effect specific to Shocking Aura, even just a longer duration on the above Boons.

One with Air
Gain Superspeed when attuning to Air.

Can only see this being useful in PvP where crits are less likely & you won’t get much opportunity to apply Auras to allies.

Ferocious Winds
Gain Ferocity based on 7% of Precision.

Raw damage buff, building upon what’s already present in Power builds.

Electric Discharge
Single target damage & Vulnerability when switching to Air / finishing Air Overload. Crits for +100% the usual amount.

More benefits for switching to Air. Could’ve done with a Shocking Aura in PvE too. This one retains the ability to crit because it’s in Air I guess.

Inscription
Gain a Boon when casting a Glyph. Glyphs recharge 20% quicker.
Fire: Might | Water: Regen | Air: Swiftness | Earth: Protection

Boons given are pretty bad as it’s 1 stack of Might, Regen requiring Healing Power to scale, Swiftness being easily given / not needed and Protection only lasting 3s. Glyphs recharging quicker might be useful but not enough to warrant choosing them if you’re not already using them. Big opportunity cost compared to the others.

Raging Storm
Crits grant 4s Fury, 8s ICD. Gain Ferocity while under Fury.

Helps sustain Fury duration and makes Fury a little better for yourself. Better in open world solo play.

Stormsoul
Deal +10% strike damage to hard CC’d (cannot attack) or defiant (CC immune) enemies. Outgoing Stun duration increased by 33%.

+10% damage in boss fights is huge since they’re almost always CC immune. And when they’re not, the group will CC it to make it even more vulnerable. Damage multipliers on top of damage multipliers. Stun duration increase is nice but not that many skills apply Stun specifically. Might’ve been better to be hard CC in general. Take if doing group content with a boss.

Aeromancer’s Training
Gain Ferocity, doubled in Air. Air weapon skills recharge 20% faster.

More damage via Ferocity and via more Air skills. Same notes about CDR apply. Little bland though, could use something relating to Swiftness or CC or critting.

Bolt to the Heart
+20% strike damage against enemies below 50% HP.

It’s extra damage under a threshold, nothing else to say.

Fresh Air
Recharge Air Attunement cooldown on crits. Gain Ferocity buff when attuning to Air.

Allows a huge amount of flexibility when critting (so always), especially with Tempest Overloads. Even though it’s more fun & interactive, it loses out to Bolt to the Heart in terms of raw damage which is the name of the game at the end of the day.

Lightning Rod
Cast Lightning Rod when you hard CC an enemy.
Lightning Rod: Damage & apply Weakness.

PvP option. There’s not enough CC in the kit to justify taking this over the other 2, and even then it’s only really taken for the Weakness.
Earth

Stone Flesh
-7% strike damage taken while in Earth.

Become tankier while in Earth, makes sense. Could use something for Condition builds though, like Condition Duration if Condition Damage is going on Fire. Same note about half effect in other elements too.

Earth’s Embrace
Gain Barrier when attuning to Earth from another element.

On demand Barrier for more survivability & sustain. Attunements have a 10s cooldown when leaving by default, 8s total to leave and re-enter Earth for Weaver and 20s if Overload Earth was used by Tempest. While it’s a sound idea for a defensive trait, its effects aren’t strong enough for its effective cooldown, not to mention you’d be screwing yourself over just entering and leaving Earth for a shield. 

Previously casted Armor of Earth when below 50% HP, granting Protection, Stability & breaking stuns. So its main function has changed too from emergency defense to sustain. Possibly re-adding Protection / Stability if the Barrier breaks w/ an ICD.

Serrated Stones
+20% Bleeding duration you inflict. +5% damage against Bleeding enemies.

Offensive option. Revolves around DoTs which fits the theme.

Elemental Shielding
Auras you grant also grant Protection.

Support option. Makes Auras a little bit better. Could also have something specific for Magnetic Aura to make it stand out even more from the other Aura traits. Probably not Stability as that’s more of an emergency / on demand Boon rather than 100% uptime like Protection. Perhaps Resolution, the Condition version of Protection.

Earthen Blast
PBAoE damage & Cripple when attuning to Earth / completing Earth Overload. Cannot crit.

Earth version of the Fire PBAoE, so the same notes apply. Could also use Bleeding somewhere, either in base or another trait. Can’t crit because of PvP, yippee.

Strength of Stone
Gain Condition Damage based on 10% of Toughness. Bleed enemies you Immobilize (3s ICD).

More DoT damage the tankier you are. Pick if you chose this tree for the DoT damage. Also adds some more Bleed for rooting enemies (requires specific weapons or utilities taken though). Could be changed to CC in general to make it more universal.

Rock Solid (you will lose!)
PBAoE Stability when attuning to Earth from another element.

Support option for on demand Stability. Same notes about the effective cooldown apply here. Whilst Stability is very powerful when used correctly, building around it and messing up your rotation isn’t worth it, especially for 2 whole seconds of it.

Earthen Blessing
-33% duration of Chilled, Cripple & Immobilize on self. Restore endurance when receiving any of them.

PvP option, there’s no way those 3 Conditions are prevalent enough in PvE to warrant taking it.

Geomancer’s Training
-10% strike damage from nearby enemies. Earth weapon skills recharge 20% faster.

General tankiness from enemies in close range. More Earth skills, you know the drill. It being direct damage reduction as opposed to Toughness does seem like it’s trying not to make Strength of Stone too powerful.

Diamond Skin
Remove 1 condition when hit while >= 75% HP. 1s ICD.


Some utility to reward being tanky. ICD is understandable, don’t want it too strong in multitarget fights but HP conditional seems like it’s only there because of PvP, it should be reduced. Could also be changed to be Conditions removed every X seconds in combat, X reduced every time hit to make it a viable option for when you’re successfully dodging / blocking.

Written in Stone
Signets recharge 20% faster & retain passives while recharging.

Technically the offensive option as it means more Signet of Fire, the big Burn utility (and also Signet of Healing but to a lesser degree of effectiveness). Out of all the Utility specific traits, this has got to be the most effective and useful of the lot since it changes functionality in a good way rather than slapping on a small Boon / Aura.

Stone Heart
Gain a buff for 4s when entering Earth and 2s when exiting where you cannot be crit.

Hyperspecific active mitigation. Don’t believe most PvP builds have a high chance of critting except for very specific ones. PvE mobs also don’t have a high chance of critting either. Should just be changed to strike damage reduction instead. Keep the buff implementation though, it allows flexibility as opposed to the original “can’t be crit while in Earth” variation.
Water

Soothing Mist
PBAoE HoT over 10s while in Water, refreshing duration every 3s.

Extra form of healing while in Water. Base form is not effective for non-Healing builds though (DPS / Support). Unfortunately there’s nothing that directly makes it better for those builds either. Could’ve possibly had a trait that made it debuff enemies for the Ele only (to avoid having to take Ele specifically for this buff for other players). Additionally could be made into Regen so it’s affected by other traits; will require adjustments like the cleansing Regen one (like a higher refresh timer).

Soothing Ice
Gain Regen & Frost Aura when crit, 20s ICD.

Requires both being hit and being crit and has a big CD. Almost the default option if not needing the Burning & Chilled cleansing for support / low damage builds.

Piercing Shards
+33% Vulnerability duration inflicted by you. +10% strike damage against Vulnerable foes (any stacks), doubled in Water.

Offensive option. Plays into the Vulnerability (support) theme of Water (which is support & healing). That being said, Vulnerability is so common amongst even 5 players so the increased duration isn’t even that useful. Possibly change it to applying extra stacks or Vulnerability is twice as effective for the Ele, like every other trait from other classes that improve Vulnerability.

Stop, Drop, and Roll
Dodging removes Burning & Chilled from self & nearby allies. 10s ICD.

Some extra on-demand cleansing. Worthless if the fight has no Burning or Chilled, which means the default choice for support builds would be Soothing Ice by elimination.

Healing Ripple
PBAoE heal when attuning to Water from another element or Overload Water.

Water version of the “do X when changing to Y” trait. Crit heals don’t exist so it’s just an extra bit of healing. No reason not to in PvE to be honest. Makes crit not a dead stat for healers and it’s less miserable to see a crit of 100 damage when you crit for 5k healing. Other than that, could use something for support like a cleanse or Chilling / applying Vulnerable to enemies.

Soothing Disruption
Cantrips grant Regen & Vigor.

Equally as bad as the Conjure and Glyph ones. Same notes for them apply. At least the Glyph one reduced the cooldown.

Cleansing Wave
PBAoE Condition cleanse when attuning to Water.

This could easily be merged with Healing Ripple (at least in PvE) to grant another slot here. Something Healing related as none of the 3 are currently Healing based.

Flow like Water
+10% strike damage while >= 75% HP. Blocking / Evading an attack heals you.

Offensive option. Adds another layer of keeping your HP above a certain level, though if you play like me you want to be topped off always because of how squishy Eles are. The 2nd portion helps maintain the 1st portion, synergising with itself.

Aquamancer’s Training
+15% Healing to others. Water weapon skills recharge 20% faster.

Constant healing to others increase. More Water skills = you know the drill 2.0.

Cleansing Water
Granting Regen also cleanses 1 Condition on the recipient.

Fine option if cleansing is needed. Following along with the idea of Soothing Mist being a Regen instead of a unique buff, this entire section could be changed to revolve around Soothing Mist and have a utility, offensive and healing option.

Powerful Aura
Auras granted to self also granted to nearby allies.

This should be basekit for the weapon skills that grant Auras and be changed to apply Regen on Auras. Could also be moved to where Cleansing Wave currently is and replaced with an offensive option for Soothing Mist so there’s a choice between utility, offense and healing.

Soothing Power
Soothing Mist’s healing is twice as powerful.

Healing option, nothing else to be said.
Arcane

Arcane Prowess
Gain 1 stack of Might when switching Attunements.

Gives you a bit of a benefit when switching Attunements but seriously, 1 Might? Used to be 2s of Fury which was at least somewhat useful. Going off of my dislike for Quickness & Alacrity as a shareable Boon, this could be changed to grant a couple seconds of Quickness to self so that the first skill or 2 when swapping go out quicker, making it feel more dynamic when you switch.

Arcane Precision
Crits have a 33% chance to apply a condition based on Attunement, 3s ICD:
Fire: Burning | Water: Vulnerability | Air: Weakness | Earth: Bleeding

Double layered RNG, gross. At least crit is usually 100%. Not sure if ICD is for all or just each Attunement, either way it should be just per Attunement to streamline it. Other than that, it’s the only damaging option of the 3 (and only if in Fire or Earth, Water doesn’t count as enemies will almost always have max Vuln).

Renewing Stamina
Gain Vigor on crit. 10s ICD.

At least this one is guaranteed on crit. 50% uptime so it’s useful for extra dodges = active mitigation and whatever dodge related traits taken. Better off leaving it to a support / healer though.

Arcane Restoration
Heal self when swapping Attunements.

Some sustain when swapping Attunements. More of a PvP trait as PvE usually doesn’t call for sustained healing that otherwise can’t be done by a healer.

Elemental Attunement
PBAoE Boon when swapping to a new Attunement:
Fire: Might | Water: Regen | Air: Swiftness | Earth: Protection

AoE Boons which match the Attunement’s theme. Helpful for maintaining Boons, ignoring the fact that Fire is still 1 Might (cap is 25).

Arcane Resurrection
Cast Geyser (Staff Water 3) when reviving an ally. Geyser partially revives allies. Also gain an aura based on Attunement when beginning a revive on an ally:
Fire: Fire Aura | Water: Frost Aura | Air: Shocking Aura | Earth: Magnetic Aura

Good trait since it adds some functionality to an existing skill. That said, it somewhat forces you to take that weapon just for that skill to get max value. Aura line isn’t really useful in PvE unless traited into Aura traits. Support / heal skill, take if building that.

Elemental Lockdown
Whenever you hard CC an enemy, gain a Boon based on Attunement, 1s ICD:
Fire: Might | Water: Regen | Air: Fury | Earth: Protection

Requires hard CC which is few and far between. Not useful in PvE generally because bosses are immune to CC. ICD to standardise between single target and multi target.

Final Shielding
Cast Lesser Arcane Shield when using an Elite skill. 20s ICD.
Lesser Arcane Shield: same as Arcane Shield, but doesn’t break stun or crit.

Used to be a stun break and shield block when <= 50% HP, now it’s tied to the most disappointing part of Eles. None of the skills have a CD anywhere near 20s other than the Elemental one and that requires it to stay alive and spam its Command almost on cooldown (15s). Also requires holding Elites for the defensive effect, it’s not really a “Final” Shielding in most cases where you want to use your powerful ability.

Elemental Enchantment
Gain Concentration (boon duration stat) & Attunements recharge 15% faster.

The Concentration is generally the reason to go down this tree (+ the ressing trait) which bodes pretty poorly for the tree in general if the best thing is a stat increase. Lowering the cooldown of Attunements is nice but not at all needed. Cooldown of the element left shouldn’t matter as you should use all you need before leaving and the cooldown between non-used elements is negligible.

Evasive Arcana
While in combat, cast a skill while Dodging based on Attunement, 10s ICD per skill:
Fire: Flame Burst = PBAoE damage & Burn.
Water: Cleansing Wave = PBAoE heal & cleanse.
Air: Blinding Flash = PBAoE Blind.
Earth: Shock Wave = PBAoE damage, Bleeding, Cripple & Blast.

Another good trait that adds functionality to existing mechanics in a non-Boon / stat buff way. Buffs the dodge to add additional effects, most useful being the Water & Earth ones. Definitely looks as though the Earth one is overloaded compared to Air though, could use some additional effects for the weaker ones.

Elemental Surge
Arcane skills recharge 20% faster, grant a Ferocity buff & inflict a Condition based on attunement:
Fire: Burning | Water: Chilled | Air: Blindness | Earth: Immobilize

Possible to maintain a high uptime on this by using multiple Arcane skills but it doesn’t feel like they fit in on an Elementalist. I wouldn’t miss it if this tree was removed, its traits merged into the other 4 and the associated skills were gone. The effect itself is pretty cool, gives you a buff to maintain but not strong enough to do so due to power creep & opportunity cost for the Utility skill slots.

Bountiful Power
Deal +2% strike damage per unique Boon on you, max 24% (12 Boons).

It is very rare to maintain 12 Boons as some are scarce / don’t last long. Requires relying on others for max value as there are some Boons that Ele don’t get access to at all. Other than that it’s kind of boring since it’s a damage boost you generally can’t control. Could use an extra effect relating to Boons to differentiate it from the other 3 traits that do the same thing (2 of which have another effect like increased Concentration and grant allies Boons when using a Profession mechanic). Maybe increased effect of certain Boons depending on current Attunement.

Tempest Combat
Same as core Elementalist, but has the following changes:
Gains access to Warhorn, allowing new skills which are support oriented.
Gains access to Overloads after staying in an Attunement for 6s, a powerful channelled skill which then puts that Attunement on a 20s cooldown. Very annoying if interrupted.
Gains access to Shout skills, PBAoE effects for both allies and enemies.
Gain access to the Tempest traitline. This uses up 1 traitline and is unique from other Elite specialisations (they all use the 3rd tree slot).
Tempest Abilities
Overloads

Overload Fire
Breaks stun. Channelled Fire combo field around self while combo Whirling. Grant Might to allies & Burning to enemies. Leaves a tornado that continues pulsing effects.

All Overloads break stun, allowing you to begin channelling anytime. This gives them an extra layer of decision making: use now for damage / utility or save for a stun break. 

Effect itself matches the Fire theme: damage, Burning & Might (which is in turn more damage). Extra combo fields are always nice, especially Fire for damage reasons.

Overload Water
Breaks stun. Channelled pulsing heal & cleanse. Burst heal, AoE Regen & Vigor at the end of cast.

Non-damaging heal & cleanse. However, it’s only used in emergencies since using an Overload puts that Attunement on a 20s cooldown. Meaning you’ll be forced to stay in Water if you want to keep up the Soothing Mist HoT, which you should be doing if you’re caring about using Overload Water. Otherwise other builds can use it as another way to cleanse but it’s better off being left for the support / healers. Effects all match the Water theme: healing & cleansing. Could use some more offensive leaning effects like Chill or any combo related effects like a Water / Ice field.

Overload Air
Breaks stun. Channelled PBAoE strikes of damage & Vulnerability. PBAoE buff that deals extra damage on attack & lightning combo field that continues the strikes at the end of cast.

Damage & debuffs all related to Air: strike damage. Leaves the rare Lightning field for use too. Damage buff only applies to the next hit on a single target so there’s some jankiness in AoE situations but other than that, it’s a decent skill. Possibly could use Swiftness just to match the other 3 Overloads, maybe some CC since that’s meant to be the trademark of Air: strike damage & CC.

Overload Earth
Breaks stun. Grant self Stability & pulse Protection, damage, Cripple & Bleeding. Immobilize, Blast combos & leave an AoE (not field) dealing the same pulsing effects at the end of the cast.

Provides defensive Boons and Bleeding, matching the Earth theme. Only real issue is that it doesn’t leave a combo field, but that’s most likely because there’s no such thing as an “Earth” field. Only Poison and Smoke are remotely close to Earth and even then it’s a stretch. Blasting Poison is just AoE weakness, which might work but thematically a bit weird. Blasting Smoke is AoE stealth which would absolutely overload this skill.

Warhorn
Support oriented. Off-hand only.

Heat Sync
Grant Might to self, then spread current stacks of Might & Fury to allies.

These Warhorns skills can be divided into 2 categories: support & AoE. This is the support skill and is essential to providing Might & Fury uptime to your subgroup (group of 5, raids / strikes are 10. This only hits 5). Usage itself isn’t that interesting. Stack up Might & Fury at the beginning then use this on cooldown.

Wildfire
Frontal Fire combo field that damages & Burns.

Just another Fire combo field. Damages & Burns which is all we can ask for. Does damage evenly without RNG unlike other skills for this weapon.

Tidal Surge
Frontal AoE heal & Regen for allies, damage & knockback for enemies.

Due to the offensive & defensive nature, you’re presented with an option to use it as part of healing or save it for when CC is needed. Fight knowledge helps with that and its versatility makes it a useful skill to have.

Water Globe
Frontal moving Water combo field that heals.

Healing AoE field, with the unique property of moving forward. Not always useful and just ends up requiring you standing behind the group and facing the boss but there’s something extra to play around as opposed to a standard frontal AoE.

Cyclone
Frontal AoE that damages, & Pulls enemies while granting allies (+self) Swiftness.

Since Swiftness isn’t in high demand, this is exclusively saved for CC. Unfortunately that makes the skill slightly less interesting than Tidal Surge. Still, it is the only source of Pull for Eles excluding using the Earth C*njure.

Lightning Orb
Frontal moving orb that fires non-piercing projectiles, damaging & applying Vulnerability to enemies.

An incredibly problematic skill because of its RNG. 42 projectiles are fired and since they’re non-piercing, they might not hit the intended target. On an average sized target, a target will be hit 14 times which is a HUGE difference from the 42 on a large sized hitbox. Make the projectiles piercing and it should resolve the RNG issue as having damage be dependent on hitbox makes for inconsistency which never feels good for anyone involved. Other than that, it’s just damage & Vulnerability 42 times which is a huge number.

Sand Squall
Grant Protection to self & allies. Increase duration of all Boons on self & allies by 3s. Grant self Magnetic Aura. Blast combo fields.

Part of the Boon support skills. Generally used after Fire Overload -> Heat Sync -> Earth Attunement -> Sand Squall to blast the Fire field from Fire Overload. That being said, since it’s part of maintaining Boon uptime, it’s just used on cooldown using the above combo, so the Magnetic Aura won’t usually ever be timed to block something on purpose. Same applies to Protection but at least that stacks in duration with other sources.

Dust Storm
Summon dust storms randomly around self that damage, Bleed & Blind enemies.

The other problematic skill. Randomly spawned storms, a total of 4. On average enemies will be hit by 1 or 2. This needs to be changed to be a PBAoE that follows for consistency’s sake. It being short ranged will also fit with the Earth theme since its tree has traits that only work while near enemies. Otherwise make it spawn underneath the target a single storm.

Shouts

“Wash the Pain Away!” - Heal
PBAoE channelled, pulsing & front-loaded heal w/ cleanse at end.

Party heal option. Front-loaded so can technically cancel if needed but you’ll need to fully channel for both max value and the cleanse. Take it if playing healer / support. Not that great for solo since the heal is on the medium/low end and there are better sources of Condition cleansing, if that’s even needed in PvE. Other than that, it’s a medium range PBAoE like the others. Strong party effects that require you to get somewhat close for usage.

“Feel the Burn!” - Utility
PBAoE Might & Fire Aura for allies & damage & Burning for enemies.

A whole bunch of fire related buffs and debuffs in 1 go. For some reason, the PvP version has 2 charges of this skill, allowing stockpiling or using 1 and keeping the other just in case. No real reason for that other than possibly helping with Might generation but there’s also no reason why PvE shouldn’t also get it.

“Eye of the Storm!” - Utility
PBAoE stun break, Superspeed, Swiftness & Stability for allies.

Everything needed to break allies out of a stun and escape safely. Only thing missing is the Shocking Aura in PvE. Possibly thinking skill is already overloaded with stuff but the Aura would’ve been handy for Aura related traits, especially since Auras are meant to be a defining aspect of Elementalist.

“Aftershock!” - Utility
PBAoE Protection, Aegis & Magnetic Aura for allies & damage, Cripple & Immobilize for enemies. Also Blasts combos.

If you thought the above was overloaded, wait until you see this one. Convinced the above should have the Shocking Aura now. Whole bunch of the usual Earth effects but its most important aspect is that it’s on-demand Aegis & Magnetic Aura, allowing you to completely bypass some mechanics if timed properly.

“Flash-Freeze!” - Utility
PBAoE Regen & Frost Aura for allies & damage & Chilled for enemies.

A lot more tame compared to the previous 2. Water version, not much else to say. Possibly could use Resistance (timed buff to ignore non-damaging Conditions, soft CC) for allies & Vulnerability for enemies to make it a bit more impactful in both offensive & defensive directions. Meaning there’s more of a choice on when to use it because right now, it’s exclusively used for the Regen & Frost Aura.

“Rebound!” - Elite
PBAoE Fury & buff for allies that ignores the next lethal attack & heals instead. If death buff expires naturally, gain an Aura based on current Attunement.

Very powerful Elite that can ignore mechanics, if used perfectly. Otherwise it’s an incredibly mediocre Fury & Aura buff. That being said, if you’re going a support build it’s a pretty decent choice, but only because the other options absolutely suck compared to it. Just requires a bit of fight knowledge for it to be useful. Which means it won’t be that useful in open world stuff where it’s just chaos usually.

Traits

Singularity
Gain access to Overloads & Shouts.

Only including this because you need to put points into it and it’s technically the first trait in the tree.

Gale Song
PBAoE Protection when using a healing skill.

Bit of extra survivability. Used to be an automatic party stun break when CC’d via an “Eye of the Storm!”. Could lean more into that and also make it so healing skills gain the break stun effect on self, on a cooldown. Also side note, that previous effect had a 5 minute cooldown in PvP. Yikes.

Latent Stamina
PBAoE Vigor when attuning to Water. Granting Vigor also restores Endurance to recipients.

Bit of extra Boons when attuning to Water. Seems a little bit too specific compared to the other traits though, but that’s fine. Just something I noted. Endurance related trait so it’s more active mitigation; defensive w/ some utility if the dodge traits were chosen. Not sure why there’s an ICD since you can’t enter Water more than once every 10s as a Tempest anyway.

Unstable Conduit
Overloads grant an aura based on the Attunement upon completion.
Fire: Fire Aura | Water: Frost Aura | Air: Shocking Aura | Earth: Magnetic Aura

Overload related trait. If it was on cast rather than end, it would definitely make it safe for Overloads to be started but there’s a huge discrepancy in terms of defensiveness when comparing a Fire Aura and a Magnetic Aura, so it makes sense for it to be at the end. That being said, it’s not that useful. Out of the 3 options, none of them are really offensive.

Gathered Focus
Gain Concentration. Doubled if >= 90% HP.

A whole lot of extra Boon duration stats. Pretty much solidifies this spec as the support spec (which inversely means its DPS capabilities kind of suck in comparison). Health threshold is not that important except in solo / PvP.

Tempestuous Aria
Shouts grant Might to allies & apply Weakness to enemies, in addition to base effects.

Little bit of extra Might & Weakness isn’t really worth taking this trait, especially compared to the other 2. Used to also increase the number of targets hit from 5 to 10 but all of those have been removed when they decided AoE Boon related things are capped at 5 for balance purposes (2 Booners + 3 DPS per subgroup). Possibly also make Shouts have charges in PvE for more flexibility?

Harmonious Conduit
Gain Stability & Swiftness when starting an Overload.

Most important part is the Stability which lasts just long enough to help make sure the Overload completes (unless you get CC’d twice). Extra buffer of protection which means more reliability = more practical damage & other effects.

Invigorating Torrents
Auras you grant also grant Regen & Vigor.

Aura support related trait. Makes Auras better with healing & endurance regen = more active mitigation.

Hardy Conduit
Gain Protection when starting an Overload. Protection is stronger on self (33% -> 39.6% damage reduction).

Even more survivability during Overloads when you’re most vulnerable. Nothing else to be said; it achieves that via 2 different ways (technically both Protection but yeah).

Transcendent Tempest
Overloads are available after 4s instead of 6s. Completing an Overload grants 15% all damage bonus.

DPS Overload option. More (unique) Overloads + damage buff = more damage. Also makes it so you want to save your most damaging skills for after Overloads, which is what you would be doing naturally anyway since they’re available from the start of combat.

Lucid Singularity
Overload pulses & successful completion grant Alacrity (increased recharge speed).

Support Overload option. Only way for Elementalists to provide Alacrity. Since this is an Elite specialisation and base Eles have no way of providing Quickness or Alacrity to others, it will never run into an issue where it can provide both causing a balance nightmare. Feelings about Quickness and Alacrity are still the same. Wouldn’t mind it providing a unique buff to the Elementalist only with the same effect of Quickness and/or Alacrity though, giving Overloads even more of a high in combat.

Elemental Bastion
Heal allies you grant Auras to. Grant Frost Aura to self & allies when stuck <= 75% HP. 30s ICD.

Even more utility to Auras. This honestly could be merged with Invigorating Torrents and be changed to be the healing Overload option. The 2nd portion is just a bit more survivability when under fire.

Weaver Combat
Gains access to Sword, allowing new skills which are melee ranged.
Attunements always have a 4s cooldown. This, in theory, provides a lot more flexibility when switching Attunements since the cooldown is lowered for the exited Element but it raises the cooldown for switching to a new Attunement from 1s to 4s, sacrificing 2 Attunements for 1 which you would’ve already used the abilities for. Balance wise it makes sense and fits the theme of flowing through the elements but it feels bad compared to being able to quickly react.
Swapping out of an Attunement will put it in your offhand for weapon skill purposes (4, 5).
Attunement you swapped into will be in your main hand for weapon skill purposes (1, 2).
The 3rd weapon skill will be a unique Weaver Dual Attack skill if main hand and offhand are different Attunements, regardless of element order (Fire + Water is the same as Water + Fire). If they’re the same, it will be the usual core Elementalist skill.
Gains access to Stance skills which are generally self buffs / effects.
Gains access to the Weaver traitline. This uses up 1 traitline and is unique from other Elite specilisations (they all use the 3rd tree slot).
Weaver Abilities
Sword
Short ranged & versatile (offensive, defensive, mobility).

Fire Strike -> Fire Swipe -> Searing Slash
Frontal cleave, damage.
Frontal cleave, more damage.
Frontal cleave, most damage & Burning.

Each of the 1 attack combos for Sword pretty much do the same thing and have most of the damage & effects being backloaded, but with their own Elemental twist. In Fire’s cast, there’s burning. That being said, part 1 and 2 of the combo for Fire is actually the weakest of all elements. It does less damage than Air and the same as Water & Earth but they have the heal & Bleed components. Fire combo 1 & 2 should have more damage or also have Burning on them.

Tracking where you’re up to in the combo takes some getting used to: there’s so much visual noise that trying to see where you’re up to is difficult. Eying the HUD at the bottom isn’t that great either since it will hurt your ability to do mechanics. Also can’t really keep a count in your head because of the difference in speed between with Quickness and without.

Flame Uprising
Combo Leap forward then AoE Fire Combo field, damaging & Burning. Very long animation lock.

Pretty cool ability if it weren’t for the horrendous animation lock. It takes 0.75s to fire and you’re also locked into the animation until it’s done. This is supposed to be the mobility skill out of the 3 and it doesn’t act like it at all. Other than that it does damage & Burns which is part of the Fire theme. 

Cauterizing Strike
Frontal cleave, damaging & Burning. 60% bonus damage if enemy is already burning.

Basic frontal AoE that does Fire related damage. Extra conditional for Burning targets to take more damage (which they should be almost always in PvE).

Seiche -> Clapotis -> Breaking Wave
Frontal cleave, damage. Heal per target hit.
Frontal cleave, more damage. Same heal per target hit.
Frontal cleave, most damage. PBAoE heal.

Same notes for Sword autos apply. Water provides healing as expected. All 3 skills don’t have Chill or Vulnerability at all so that could be added somewhere, maybe the 3rd part of the combo or Aqua Siphon.

Riptide
Visually spin & Evade backwards, damaging & applying Regen to self. Leave a Water combo field that pulses healing.

It's a bit annoying that you’re spinning away but don’t have a combo Whirl component. The Evade is probably the only useful aspect to it for DPS since the damage is low (honestly didn’t realise there was a damage component) and the healing & regen from the skill & water combo field are weak and don’t scale with DPS. If the spinning damage also Chilled enemies it would make it a lot more useful in terms of self peel for DPS (in PvE, this is a very good skill in PvP).

Aqua Siphon
Frontal single target attack, damaging the enemy & healing & applying Regen to allies.

Does very little damage but has a decent heal attached. It being single-target doesn’t really matter since it’s not used for the damage, but will be an issue if Chill / Vulnerability is added to it as per the notes above. The issue is that it takes at least 4s to get to and requires you to attune to Water twice which is at least 8s of being stuck with Water skills. This is very bad for DPS as they are all seemingly geared towards healing or CC. If you feel like you need to use this skill for the healing, you’re probably already dead. It would be a lot better if the Attunement ICD was lower.

Charged Strike -> Polaric Slash -> Call Lightning
Frontal cleave, damage.
Frontal cleave, more damage & grant self Swiftness.
Frontal cleave, most damage & extra lightning strikes for more damage.

Same notes for Sword autos apply. Air providing the most damage out of the 4 as expected. Can’t attach hard CC to an auto so this is as good as it’s going to get.

Polaric Leap
Instant combo Leap to a single enemy to damage & Daze. If the enemy is interrupted, gain Superspeed.

Strictly used for mobility or CC as the damage is minimal & using a skill just for the combo Leap is silly. Issue about Attunement ICD applies though; if you need mobility or CC when you just switched to Fire + Earth means you’re locked out for 4s. Extra line about Superspeed is mostly for PvP since you’re never going to interrupt anything in PvE due to CC immunity or having only instant attacks.

Quantum Strike
Single target attack w/ lightning strikes for more damage & Vulnerability.

This being a single target attack feels bad since it’s a lot of damage that could go on the wrong enemy. There’s no reason for it not to cleave since it’s both melee and has a long-ish cooldown like all the other Sword 3 skills. Damage itself is very good despite it being a reskinned Call Lightning (same lightning bolts, but purple). More Vulnerability for more damage; that should be a shared theme w/ Water.

Crystal Slash -> Crystalline Strike -> Crystalline Sunder
Frontal cleave, damage & Bleed.
Frontal cleave, more damage & Bleed.
Frontal cleave, most damage, Bleed & Cripple.

Same notes for Sword autos apply. Earth applying Bleeding & Cripple as expected. Could add a small defensive aspect to it as well, maybe a small barrier on the 3rd hit.

Earthen Vortex
Visually spin into the ground, Evading attacks. Burst out to damage, Bleed, Cripple & Blast combos.

Same note about visually spinning and not having a Whirl combo. Whirls aren’t even that strong or reliable since the projectiles spun out are sent out randomly. It does an okay amount of damage but is mostly just used for the combo Blast or Evade since the other skills (and even Autos) do more damage.

Rust Frenzy
Channelled frontal cleave w/ windup animation, damaging & Bleeding. 

Very easy to interrupt because it’s the only channelled skill on Weaver Sword where you can’t move. Plus it has a windup & channel so there’s even more opportunity to mess it up. That said it’s very rare to even use this skill since it requires Attuning to Earth twice; the same note as Aqua Siphon applies.

Dual Attacks
Sword

Twin Strike - Fire + Water
Frontal 2 hit cleave, damaging, Burning & Chilling enemies.

Does decent damage and it’s pretty quick too. Generally don’t go into Water as DPS so this is strictly only used during Weave Self which requires cycling through all the Elements for max value. Since you’re in Water, you might as well use it.

Pyro Vortex - Fire + Air
Frontal cleave, damaging & leaving behind a Fire (not a combo) field on each enemy. Field damages & Burns.

Fire & Air share the common theme of damage. Does a lot of damage through the fire (not combo) fields which means there’s some counterplay by moving out of them. 

Lava Skin - Fire + Earth
Self buff for Barrier & Stability. Pulse damage & Burning for enemies, Barrier for self.

Fire & Earth share the theme of DoTs so this ability having a bunch of Burning makes sense. It being a one off cast means you can swap into it, use it and then swap out without any hassle. Barrier isn’t strong enough to warrant it being saved as a defensive skill, but there is some sustain since it’s pulsing as opposed to 1 big burst of shielding. Being both melee & squishy, we take what we can get.

Shearing Edge - Water + Air
Frontal mid-ranged projectile that damages, Chills & Bleeds.

Does decent damage and provides some extra utility. Being ranged is also helpful but not enough to save it for downtime, 12s CD anyway. Bleed is sort of random, if they wanted more damage they could’ve upped the direct damage and add Vulnerability instead, which was a shared theme between Water & Air.

Natural Frenzy - Water + Earth
Frontal channelled volley of non-piercing projectiles which damage, Bleed & apply Vulnerability.

You’d think Water + Earth would lean towards defensive / healing. Instead, it goes for DoTs & “support” (Vulnerability). It being channelled & non-piercing / single target makes it feel really janky to use. Damage itself is fine but since you’re going into both Water & Earth it’s overall weaker since you’re stuck in either one of them when you could be in Fire or Air.

Gale Strike - Air + Earth
Frontal cleave, damaging, Bleeding, applying Vulnerability & Floating (knocking up / suspending like Nami Q) enemies.

Does okay damage but you’d only use it if you’re desperate for CC. Same issue about taking a lot of time to switch to Air & Earth applies. By the time you get to it you would’ve missed the opportunity to apply the CC.
Staff

Pressure Blast - Fire + Water
Ground targeted projectile that heals allies it passes through. Explodes when hits the ground or an enemy, Regening allies + damaging & Blinding enemies.

Ground targeted AoE that damages & heals. The explosion should have the same heal as the passthrough heal to make it consistent. Damage is pretty low and there’s no burning. If they want to pass Staff as the support weapon, add combo fields to it. Either Fire or Water (can’t be both because each combo activator can only do so once and it’s seemingly random).

Plasma Blast - Fire + Air
Frontal projectile that explodes on contact or max range for damage.

This only does damage, not a Burn in sight. Other than that it’s a slow moving exploding projectile, so there’s some skill involved in getting it to hit. Pretty basic, could also use a Fire field if pushing Staff to be support.

Pyroclastic Blast - Fire + Earth
Ground targeted AoE Fire Combo field. Damages & Burns on impact + on pulse.

Like any other ground targeted Fire AoE, except there’s a bit of a delay w/ the launching. There’s nothing about it that says Earth though. Possibly Cripple or Bleed from shrapnel exploding, or Barrier on hit / for allies for more support?

Monsoon - Water + Air
Front travelling projectile that damages & Chills enemies + Regens allies per tick.

Forward wave of small damage & Chill + Regen. Apparently acts as a Water field despite not being labelled as one, not sure if intended or not but if it is that’s some extra utility. Vulnerability should also be added as per Water + Air.

Lahar - Water + Earth
Ground targeted AoE that damages & Cripples enemies. Grant self Stability.

Another ground targeted AoE, feels like Dual attacks were a bit of an afterthought for Staff. Nothing about it says Water either. It leaves a puddle but isn’t labelled as any type of Field when it could easily be Water. Also another situation where an Earth field could be useful (Poison and Smoke don’t count). Should have Bleed on it since a “Lahar” is a slurry of rock & water. Going through that would definitely cut & bleed you.

Pile Driver - Air + Earth
After a channel, launch a piercing Combo projectile that damages & Dazes enemies.

High damaging attack after a channel which makes sense. Also pierces & Dazes, building on the big damaging channelled attack idea. Could slap a Bleed on it to make it more Earth-y too since right now the only the CC is remotely Earth-y.
Dagger

Steam Surge - Fire + Water
Dash while Evading, damaging enemies & healing allies at the end. Also leaves a short Water combo field.

Bit of extra mobility for the short ranged Dagger. Damages & heals for Fire & Water. Water field only lasts for 2s, not really enough for most combos. Evade useful for iframes, skill expression. Could use some Burning since it’s hot steam.

Plasma Burst - Fire + Air
Short ranged damage & Burning cleave that Blasts combos.

Don’t know why this gets Burning but not the Staff version, they both even have Plasma in the name. Basic cleave that damages & Burns for Fire & Air. Added bonus of Blasting combos which Ele usually need (ways to exploit combos they place).

Ashen Blast - Fire + Earth
Short ranged damage, Burning & Blinding cleave.

Same as the above but trading in the Blast for a Blind which helps with survivability, albeit for a very short amount of time.

Katabatic Wind - Water + Air
Short ranged damage, Chill & Daze cleave. Regen for self. Also Blasts combos.

Lots going on but mostly for the CC since you need Water attunement. Bunch of small added bonuses. Same not about Water + Air = Vulnerability applies.

Mudslide - Water + Earth
Dash while Evading, damaging & Knocking down enemies. Leaves a trail of mud that also knocks down. Also knocks down in an AoE at the end.

Almost entirely Evade & CC, damage is negligible. Covers all cases w/ the knockdown: hitting w/ the animation, the residual field and the end so you’re not forced to aim and slide through a hitbox to get value unlike other moving skills.

Grinding Stones - Air + Earth
PBAoE damage & Bleeding. Stability & reduced damage taken for self.

Defensive buff that damages around self. Damage is reasonable but it’s the only aspect of Air involved. It’s primarily Earth with the Bleed, Stability & damage reduction. Could use some movespeed while near enemies or something like that for Air; it would synergise well with the melee range damage while not making it too strong of an escape.
Scepter

Fiery Frost - Fire + Water
Dodge & fire a single target projectile that damages, Burns & Chills.

Can be “saved” for a dodge (see note about swapping between Attunements and skills not being readily available) or used for damage. Not sure why it’s single target though. Damage, Burning & Chilled fit the skill.

Plasma Beam - Fire + Air
Channelled single target beam of damage. No movement penalties.

This one at least somewhat fits the single target nature. It should also damage in between caster and target like Scepter Air 1. Feels good to use since there’s no movement speed penalty while channelling.

Fracturing Strike - Fire + Earth
2 part single target damage, Burning & Vulnerability. 1st is instant, 2nd is delayed.

Also single target when it’s a meteor crashing and exploding? Damages, & Burns which makes sense. Vulnerability is nice but doesn’t really fit with either Fire or Earth. Bleed would’ve made more sense. Doesn’t need to have defensive aspects since Scepter is longer ranged & not support oriented usually.

Glacial Drift - Water + Air
Forward moving projectile that damages & Chills. Also grant self Stability.

Same as the other forward moving projectile AoEs. Damages & Chills which is fine. Stability is sort of random though. This is the skill that could use Fracturing Strike’s Vulnerability instead.

Stone Tide - Water + Earth
Ground targeted AoE that pulses damage, Bleeding & Vulnerability.

Another ground targeted AoE. Damage, Bleeding & Vulnerability all fit Earth & Water respectively. Doesn’t necessarily need to be a Water field since Scepter doesn’t have any field primers normally.

Earthen Synergy - Air + Earth
2 part AoE attack. 1st part damages, 2nd part is delayed, does less damage & Stuns.

Bit of damage and CC, primarily CC. This fits the Air + Earth theme. Not sure why this is AoE when Fiery Frost & Fracturing Strike aren’t. Targeted, ranged AoE CC is pretty strong.

Stances

Aquatic Stance - Healing
Small heal then self buff. Additional healing for self & allies around enemies you hit. 1s ICD. 2 charges.

Pretty mediocre heal. There’s enough time to proc the AoE heal 4 times due to ICD. Assuming all 4 heals are procced, it heals self for a medium amount and allies for a low amount. Only reason to take this is if you need party healing on a Weaver since base Ele doesn’t have party healing. 

Primordial Stance - Utility
PBAoE pulsing damage & conditions based on current Attunements. Full Attunements = double Conditions. 2 charges.
Fire: Burning | Water: Chilled | Air: Vulnerability | Earth: Bleeding

Extra damage and some debuffs depending on the current Attunements, meaning switching Attunements will update the debuffs accordingly. For max damage, generally used while exiting Fire + Air into Fire + Fire. Otherwise, can be used wherever if certain Conditions are needed but that’s generally for PvP. Skill is pretty cool in that it updates to match current Attunements.

Stone Resonance - Utility
Pulsing Barrier for self. Also grants self Stability on cast. 2 charges.

Some sustain in the form of Barrier. Gaining Barrier while having Barrier will not extend the duration of the 1st application, so it’s most effective against sustained damage. Basically, the tanky Stance.

Unravel - Utility
Temporarily fully Attune to elements, losing Dual Attacks. Gain Boons based on Attunement. Reset Attunement cooldowns. 2 charges.
Fire: Might | Water: Vigor | Air: Fury | Earth: Protection

Offers a little bit of leeway regarding swapping between Attunements. Buff lasts barely long enough to swap fully Attune twice (5s w/ 4s ICD). Honestly feels like this should either be basekit as the 5th profession button or the ICD be reduced. Remove the Boons if necessary.

Twist of Fate - Utility
Stun break, Evade & grant self Superspeed. 2 charges.

Stun break / Evasion stance. Does exactly what it says. Immune to everything except DoTs after breaking out so usually you’re safe unlike some other stun breaks. Charges allow leniency in using it as a stun break or an Evade.

Weave Self & Tailored Victory
Give self buff for 20s w/ following effects. Reduced Attunement cooldown to 2s. Gain Woven Element buff on use and when entering an Attunement. Entering all 4 Elements will get rid of Weave Self buff & grant Perfect Weave for 10s which is all 4 Woven buffs combined. Also grants access to Tailored Victory.
Woven Fire: +20% Condition Damage.
Woven Water: +20% Boon Duration, +20% Healing to Others.
Woven Air: +50% Movespeed, +10% Strike Damage.
Woven Earth+ -20% Strike Damage Taken.
Tailored Victory: Ends Perfect Weave for PBAoE damage & Float. Unblockable.

Probably the only Elite that is actually good. Reduces Attunement recharge to 2s (which I believe should be base or at least lowered to 3s for more dynamic combat). Each buff from the Attunements fit the Attunements. That said, it took almost 6 years to add the +10% damage to Woven Air, meaning this was useless offensively for power builds. But now it’s an amazing skill for both versions of DPS Weaver with the manic cycling through elements. Tailored Victory active itself is probably the only letdown as the damage is weak and there’s a cast time. If it was automatic on expiration that'd make this Elite perfect. Do that change in PvE only if you have to, it shouldn’t suffer just because of another game mode.

Traits

Weaver
Allows dual wielding Attunements, reducing all recharges to 4s. Gain access to Dual Attacks & Stances.

Only placing this here because like Tempest, it’s technically the 1st trait in the tree.

Superior Elements
Dual Attacks Weaken enemies. Attacks against Weakened enemies have +15% chance of critting. 4s ICD.

Offensive option. Not that useful for DoT builds since they don’t build crit chance or damage but it’s better than nothing. Weaken should always be on the enemy in instanced content so this is basically +15% crit for power builds. Not sure why this has an ICD in PvE. The only thing this does is mess up how often it’s applied if the Weaver has Alacrity (CDR) as there’s a 4s cooldown between swapping Attunements which is affected by Alacrity to recharge quicker.

Elemental Pursuit
Gain 2s of Superspeed when inflicting Immobilize, Chilled or Cripple on enemies. 10s ICD.

Mobility option, but with all the blinks on some Ele weapons + Utility skills, there’s no need for this in PvE. It’s definitely more of a PvP trait. Grants mobility in an active way (you need to apply the CC) so it’s more involved w/ you the player.

Master’s Fortitude
Gain Vitality when wielding a Sword. Gain Vitality based on 5% of Power & 5% of Condition Damage.

Extra HP that scales with damage stats. Helps the (usually) melee Weaver survive better, especially since Ele base stats suck the most out of all professions. Since it’s just passive stats, it’s not all that interesting but you may get use out of it if you’re not building crit / power, especially paired with Elements of Rage which increases crit chance based on Vitality stat (see below).

Elemental Refreshment
Grant self & allies barrier when using a Dual Attack.

Barrier is pretty small and the ally clause was only added 5 years after release. Still, it’s some free constant sustain since it’s always chosen if you're a Weaver and you should always be cycling through the Attunements anyway.

Weaver’s Prowess
Gain +10% Condition Damage & +20% Condition Duration when Attuning to a different element (from the main hand Attunement).

More Condition Damage & Duration for DoT builds. The buff lasts long enough to cover entering & exiting an Attunement twice (so Fire + Air -> Fire + Fire -> Earth + Fire will all be covered with the buff). That said it should just be on any Attunement swapping as that line is only affecting Unravel which is rarely used in general and never used in Condition builds. Reduce the duration if needed. Otherwise, encourages active cycling between Attunements which is what Weaver is about: flow.

Swift Revenge
Gain Swiftness when using a Dual Attack. +15% Strike Damage while under Swiftness or Superspeed.

Power damage option for this section. Swiftness is by far the easiest Boon to get so it’s basically +15% damage. Less interesting compared to the above in terms of application.

Bolstered Elements
Gain Barrier when using a Stance. Use Lesser Stone Resonance when <=50% HP. 70s ICD.
Lesser Stone Resonance: same pulsing Barrier as Stone Resonance but no Stability.

Used to give Stability instead of Barrier (we can all guess what game mode caused that to be changed). Give PvE Stability! It feels awful to be constantly knocked about as a squishy melee character, especially since you’d be forced to take this trait to try and counter it and miss out on damage for both power & DoT builds. Also has an emergency defensive measure but if you get spiked you’ll get downed anyway since the Barrier is pulsing.

Elemental Polyphony
Gain stats based on current Attunements. Dual attuned = gain both benefits but not double benefits if fully Attuned.
Fire: Power | Water: Healing Power | Air: Ferocity | Earth: Vitality

Some extra stats depending on your Attunements. No reason why this doesn’t give double stats while fully Attuned. In fact there’s a bug where you occasionally get double stats while fully Attuned if you enter a new map, meaning that’s probably the default case.

Elements of Rage
Gain +10% Damage & +10% Condition Damage when fully Attuning. Also gain Precision based on 13% of Vitality.

The damage option. Damage comes from specific Attunement combinations (full Attunements) so in a way it also encourages cycling through Attunements. Passive crit chance based on Vitality is also nice, but in a less exciting way. Somewhat synergises w/ Master’s Fortitude which grants Vitality based on Power & Condition Damage. Could open up a Hybrid build option, but since it’s the only trait that affects both types of damage, it doesn’t compete with a pure damage type build.

Woven Stride
Gain Swiftness when Immobilized, Crippled or Chilled. 3s ICD.
Also gain Regen when gaining Superspeed or Swiftness. No ICD.
Swiftness on self now grants 40% movespeed, up from 33%.

Mobility & sustain option. Focuses on healing damage rather than avoiding it. Definitely more of a PvP option since constantly being Conditioned is more prevalent there than it is in PvE.

Invigorating Strikes
Gain Vigor when using a Dual Attack. Dodging grants Barrier.

Also mobility & sustain option, this time focusing more on mitigating & avoiding damage in the first place rather than healing. More of a PvP option but more usable in PvE than the above since Barrier & Dodging are always welcome in PvE content whereas the above requires being constantly Conditioned which doesn’t really happen. That said, Barrier is tiny compared to the 2 Dodges you get every X seconds.

Catalyst Combat
Gains access to Hammer, allowing new skills which are both mid-ranged and melee depending on the Attunement (Fire + Air & Water + Earth respectively).
Don’t love the Hammer choice, but have grown to not hate it. Would’ve preferred a ranged Greatsword like Mesmer.
Gains access to a 5th Profession mechanic: Jade Spheres. Deploys a Jade Sphere which changes depending on the current Attunement, placing down a Combo field that damages & grants Boons to allies. Jade Spheres require 10 Energy (can hold 30 max Energy) which are gained for each instance of hitting an enemy while a Jade Sphere is not out. Each Sphere has a 15s CD. 
It really should not have both constraints as the Energy is there to prevent camping an Attunement and spamming a Sphere, but that was when the CD was 5s. Remove the Energy as it’s tracked by a tiny ass bar at the bottom of the screen and is completely uneven in single target vs. multitarget situations AND not gaining Energy while a Sphere is out is incredibly frustrating.
Sphere itself is kind of ugly. Don’t like mixing magic w/ technology. Especially if it’s green.
Gains access to Augment Utility skills which are self buffs that get enhanced if standing inside its relevant Jade Sphere field.
Gains access to the Catalyst traitline. This uses up 1 traitline and is unique from other Elite specialisations (they all use the 3rd tree slot).
Catalyst Abilities
Jade Spheres

Deploy Jade Sphere - Fire
Ground targeted Fire Combo field that pulses damage for enemies & Might for allies.

As mentioned above, there’s no reason for it to have a big cooldown as well as an incredibly restrictive resource cost which can’t be gained while any Jade Sphere is out. Remove the Energy cost since it’s not supported in the UI whatsoever as per this:

The bar is tiny, there’s no divider to indicate each 10 energy and you just have to look for when it’s full and use 3 in a row. Other than that it’s a dedicated button for both a Combo field & Boons, the former boosting damage via Traits and the latter for support builds.

Deploy Jade Sphere - Water
Ground targeted Water Combo field that pulses damage for enemies & Resolution for allies.

Same notes as the above. Resolution being chosen for Water makes it less locked into healing. It’d be great if that train of thought could be applied to the older Water skills too.

Deploy Jade Sphere - Air
Ground targeted Lightning Combo field that pulses damage for enemies & Fury for allies.

Same notes as the above. Lightning fields are pretty rare so this is pretty handy. Fury for Air fits as its theme is damage via crits.

Deploy Jade Sphere - Earth
Ground targeted Poison Combo field that pulses damage for enemies & Protection for allies.

Same notes as the above. Poison & Smoke are the closest to an Earth field in the game and while Poison is the only actual viable option in terms of theme & balance (giving Eles stealth would be dangerous), there are no Poison related traits in the Earth tree so the combo feels like it’s shoehorned in. Protection makes sense for Earth.

Hammer
Mid-ranged + melee w/ focus on AoE & control. 

Singeing Strike
Single target mid-ranged attack, damages & Burns.

Ele Hammer is unique in that it has both melee & ranged skills in Water + Earth & Fire & Air respectively. This skill does exactly what a Fire auto would, damage + Burn. Could use a bit of AoE but other than that it’s okay.

Surging Flames
Frontal mid-ranged cleave, damages & Burns.

Sends out projectiles that pierce but can only hit an enemy once, meaning there’s no hitbox shenanigans. Mid-range, tick. Damage, tick. Burns, tick.

Flame Wheel & Grand Finale
Summon projectile that spins around you, “damaging” enemies & Burning them. Refreshes duration of all other similar projectiles. Also grants +10% Damage & +10% Condition Damage. Grants access to Grand Finale after a small ICD: send out all elemental projectiles that pierce, damage & act as Combo projectiles. Apply a Condition depending on the element.
Fire: Burning | Water: Vulnerability | Air: Weakness | Earth: Bleeding

Grand Finale is available after all Hammer spinning projectile skills.

Originally acted exactly like a projectile, meaning if you were inside a hitbox that was smaller than the radius it would straight up do no damage. Now acts as a pulsing damage field. The damage has been decreased then increased then decreased again in a matter of months. Who doesn’t love seeing a crit for 6 damage? Damage was nerfed via this skill and not the others to lower the skill floor by removing damage from an effectively passive source, keeping Ele as the higher difficulty class. The only reason it even has damage is because of the stupid Energy mechanic.

Condition = Burning which fits. Passive is damage for power & DoT which fits.

Grand Finale (+ the projectiles to a lesser degree) feel so integral to Catalyst that not using a Hammer just feels off. Tying the mechanic to the weapon instead of having it as the 5th profession mechanic and having Jade Spheres be like Tempest Overloads really limits build variety for Catalyst. If you’re playing Catalyst, you’ll be using a Hammer in 99% of cases. That said, the skill itself is a cool finisher that’s rewarding you for cycling through the Attunements and looks pretty cool when primed w/ the 4 orbs flying around you, even if they do <10 damage each. 

Launched Flame Wheel applies burning which fits too.

Triple Sear
Ground targeted AoE w/ 3 points of damage. Damages & Burns.

Multi section attack which unfortunately can hit a single target multiple times, effectively meaning the damage triples on a large target. Thankfully the variance isn’t as big as the “storm” skills, it’s on a 20s CD so it doesn’t happen too often and the spread between the spots isn’t that big but it really shouldn’t even have the ability to hit multiple times anyway. If it insists on having multiple hits, raise the base damage & make it so hits 2 & 3 only deal a percentage (not 10%).

Molten End
Delayed PBAoE, damages, & Blasts combos. Grants Might & Fury to self if it hits an enemy, increasing per enemy hit. Boons are frontloaded on 1 target.

Everything about this skill makes sense: delayed slam which does big damage around you, Blasts combos & grants offensive Boons to self. Boons themselves are frontloaded so there’s not a huge difference between single target and multitarget (6 stacks vs. 10).

Stream Strike -> Water Rush -> Chilling Crack
Frontal cleave.
Frontal cleave, same damage.
Frontal cleave, most damage & Chills.

Damage originally was different between hit 1 & 2. Could have at least made it slightly increase. Overall an offensive auto for Water; Chill is handy but still doesn’t interact with Ele in any way.

Rain of Blows
Frontal channelled cleave. If hit by all 4 strikes, become Chilled.

Pretty much the same as the above, but instead of being backloaded it’s all-loaded (?). Doesn’t mean much in PvE as all 4 hits will almost always happen unless phasing happens. Melee, cleave, damage, Chilled. As expected for Water.

Icy Coil & Grand Finale
Same as Flame Wheel, but applies Vulnerability & grants -15% Incoming Condition Damage.

Vulnerability is actually useful for Ele compared to Chilled. Reduced Condition Damage helps short ranged Ele survive better much more than increased healing (that was probably going to be only to others anyway).

Crashing Font
Combo Leap for AoE Damage. Heal if hitting an enemy, increased heal if multiple (frontloaded).

Heals for the same amount as the weaker dedicated heal buttons. Does okay damage and is a handy mid-ranged gapcloser but the main reason it’s used is for the Leap since (any) Combos are important for Catalysts due to certain Traits. Good thing it’s also frontloaded to reduce discrepancy between single target and multi target.

Cleansing Typhoon
PBAoE damage & combo Whirl. Cleanse conditions, increased # if multiple (frontloaded).

Same as the above, except instead of a heal it’s a cleanse. Not as frontloaded as the others (2 cleanses vs 5). Still handy, but again mostly for the Whirl.

Wind Slam
Single target mid-ranged damage.

Same as Fire, but trades in the DoT for more direct damage as per Air theme. Same notes apply; could use a tiny AoE at destination.

Hurricane of Pain
Ground targeted channelled AoE for pulsing damage & Vulnerability.

High damaging channelled AoE that also applies Vulnerability, matching Air theme. Since it’s ground targeted + channelled, there’s plenty of counterplay there. Only thing that would make it perfect is if there was a Whirl component on you since you’re rapidly spinning the entire time.

Crescent Wind & Grand Finale
Same as the other projectiles, but applies Weakness & grants +10% Crit Chance.

Weakness is the only other Condition associated with Air apart from Vulnerability which is taken by Water. Chill & Weakness are comparable in that they help you survive a bit better, w/ varying success since Weakness damage reduction is RNG. Crit chance for Air. This along with the damage up from Fire means you want to start your rotation with 1 or the other before moving to Water / Earth.

Wind Storm
Backstep to damage & knockdown enemies in front of you.

Decent amount of CC that can also kind of be used as an escape. It locks onto a target so you’ll have to position yourself carefully to move in a specific way. That said, I’ve been knocked back into the map / underground / stuck in a wall multiple times and am very hesitant to even use it because of this.

Shock Blast
Fire a projectile that damages enemies it passes through. Explodes for more damage, Stun & combo Blast.

A bit of damage and some more CC, but mostly for the combo Blast which works with some Traits. There isn’t much of an animation though so most of the time it doesn’t look like anything is happening other than a tiny pebble even when ignoring the visual vomit on the screen. Air = damage + CC.

Stonestrike
PBAoE damage.

It’s just PBAoE damage. Differs from the Water one which is a frontal cleave but it’s still melee. Could use a bit of Bleeding on it though, Hammer doesn’t really have good damage for DoT builds and that could help (their design philosophy is that if it can do damage it should be able to do it via both ways).

Whirling Stones
Visually spin, channelling PBAoE damage & Bleeding. Also blocks missiles / projectiles.

Yes the spinning is slow but it should still count as a Whirl. Other than that it’s a melee PBAoE damage + Bleed, fitting with Earth. Blocking missiles is a nice cherry on top and helps surviving while melee and not having a dedicated gap close outside of the one in Water.

Rocky Loop & Grand Finale
Same as the other projectiles, but applies Bleeding & grants -15% Incoming Strike Damage.

Earth for Bleeding. Strike damage reduction matching the usual Protection.

Immutable Stone
Channel for 1.5s, Blocking the next attack. If an attack was Blocked, gain Barrier & an Aura based on the current Attunement.

The fact it only blocks a single attack is a bit annoying. Yes there’s a Barrier that’s decently sized (25% of base Ele’s HP if building glass cannon) but it being eaten up by a stray attack from a random mob or being almost useless in a pack of mobs is annoying. Reduce the duration and block the entire time or keep the duration but block for 0.5s after 1st hit. If that’s an issue for PvP, split the balance between modes. Aura is whatever, mostly there for Aura related Traits. There’s some min maxing by swapping Attunements while this is channelling but not for PvE with a more structured rotation.

Ground Pound
Delayed PBAoe Damage, Immobilize & Bleed that also Blasts combos.

Earth version of the Fire slam. Sacrifices offensive Boons & direct damage for Bleeding & some soft CC. Same notes apply; it’s a great feeling slam skill.

Augments

Soothing Water - Healing
Heal & cleanse in pulses. -20% CD if used in Water Sphere.

Sacrifice all burst healing for persistent healing & cleansing that’s not channelled so you can do other things. Very rarely used within a Water Sphere since you can’t really schedule when you’re taking damage in your rotation in PvE, secondary effect more for PvP. No reason why healing was increased in PvP only though. During Beta it only cleansed if used in Water Sphere; Catalyst was a mess then.

Relentless Fire - Utility
5s buff for +10% damage. 10 attacks in 5s are Unblockable (separate buff). +3s if used in Fire Sphere.

Damage buff, more if used in Fire Sphere. Unblockable portion not relevant in PvE. Has a cast time so won’t be able to use it in the channelled abilities, which could be a cool mechanic since a couple of these are just damage buffs.

Shattering Ice - Utility
5s buff for extra AoE damage & Chill on each hit w/ 1s ICD. +3s if used in Water Sphere.

Also a damage buff but in the form of another attack rather than +X damage. Chill is also there but not that relevant in PvE. Sphere bonus is also useful as a CD reduction would mess up the flow in a rotation. Also could stand to be instant cast.

Invigorating Air - Utility
Breaks stun. 5s buff for double Endurance regen & Superspeed. -33% CD if used in Air Sphere.

Risky stun break as there’s nothing stopping you from getting CC’d again. Compared to other stun breaks, not as great but it does have a shorter cooldown. CDR rather than buff duration extension from Sphere interaction puts more weight on the active rather than the buff. Not sure why it got buffed in PvP but not in PvE.

Fortified Earth - Utility
Block attacks for 3s. Gain Barrier at end of channel. -33% CD if used in Earth Sphere.

Basically what I wanted for Hammer Earth 4. Total block for 3s > Barrier so the CDR is worth more than the buff duration extension (don’t think they can even increase Barrier duration). 

Elemental Celerity - Elite
Reset CD of all weapon skills in current Attunement. Gain Boon based on Attunement if used in a Jade Sphere.
Fire: Might | Water: Vigor | Air: Fury | Earth: Protection

Pretty boring Elite and it’s not even that good. It’s a 90s CD just like Weave Self and unlike that Elite, it just lets you use 4 abilities again quicker. Maybe if those abilities were incredibly strong but since the class is balanced around having 20 total abilities (16 non autos), only affecting 25% of the kit isn’t impressive. Would resetting all abilities be busted? Probably. Could at least reduce those ones by a little bit though. Sphere interaction is also pretty crappy since you’re guaranted those Boons in group content. Not worth the slot and honestly makes me wish you could take another Utility skill rather than be forced to use a subpar Elite.

Traits

Depth of Elements
Trait that grants access to Spheres & Augments.

Adding it here because it’s the 1st trait in the tree, etc, etc.

Hardened Auras
Gain a Damage Reduction buff (2%, max 10) when granting self an Aura. Gaining stacks refreshes duration of all stacks.

The Aura or Defensive option of the 3. As the newest spec, you can tell the Traits are set up to be going in a specific direction w/ certain groups in each choice. Not sure why this was changed to be only on Auras given to self as maintaining stacks is pretty simple w/ Elemental Epitome (below). All this does is remove edge cases which shouldn’t matter in PvE since this isn’t taken there & you should split balance between the game modes, even if it’s a functionality change.

Vicious Empowerment
Gain 2x Elemental Empowerment (+1% All Stats each) stacks (max 10) & Might when Disabling or Immobilizing an enemy. Stacks have their own duration.

The Buff or Offensive option. Doesn’t require the enemy to actually be CC’d like Bosses who are immune, just needs the ability to hit. Helps add stacks but not maintain since it doesn’t refresh the duration when gaining stacks and weapons don’t usually have more than 3 ways of applying w/ decently sized CDs. Since it’s All Stats up, it means you deal more damage & are tankier (some stats have a base value of 0 like healing power).

Energized Elements
Gain Energy (2 lol) & Fury when switching Attunements in combat.

Pretty sad option, it’s meant to be the Jade Sphere option. 2 Energy is 2 hits on an enemy when you’re allowed (gross) to gain Energy. With the amount of multi hitting abilities & AoE there are, 2 Energy is laughable. To make things worse, it’s 3 in PvP. Gaining Fury on Attunement swap is also something that used to exist in the Arcane trait line, making it seem like this was shoehorned in since they couldn’t think of a 3rd Jade Sphere related trait. The other 2 are related to the Boons given by the Spheres (adding another one and adding duration). Not much else you can do with Boons so this one could focus on the combo Field aspect of it instead, increasing duration of the fields or adding pulsing Boons to the spheres in addition to the base Boon application on use, anything but Energy which should be scrapped. Obviously rename it in that case since it won’t really have anything to do with energising.

Elemental Empowerment
Gain 3x Elemental Empowerment stacks while in combat. 15s duration, 15s refresh time. 10 max stacks.

Pretty much means you always have 3 stacks while in combat. The in combat thing only really matters in PvP.

Empowering Auras
10s +3% Damage stacks when granting self an Aura, max 15%. Duration refreshed upon stack applications.

The Aura or Offensive option, switching from the previous choice. Used to also be whenever anyone gave you an aura. Can get a 100% uptime via Elemental Epitome. Other than that, Aura = damage, nothing else to really say. Just means more combos are wanted.

Evasive Empowerment
Gain 2x Elemental Empowerment & Vigor while Evading an attack. 1s ICD.

The Buff or “Defensive” / PvP option. Doesn’t inherently make you tankier but rewards you for using active mitigation via dodging. There’s some synergy with the Dagger + Staff skills with the “Evade” tag on them. ICD is there for the cases where you dodge multiple attacks in a row, though is that necessarily needed? Not much use in PvE, there are easier ways to gain stacks and a big opportunity cost too.

Spectacular Sphere
Jade Spheres grant another Boon on use.
Fire: More Might | Water: Vigor | Air: Quickness | Earth: Aegis

The Trait that allows Catalyst to be a Support DPS option. Chosen just for the Quickness Boon, 1 of the 2 that caused so many balance issues (there was a timeframe where every group had a Chronomancer because they were the only ones who could apply any of those Boons). Previously had a -10% damage dealt modifier which was absolutely disgusting considering you’re already missing out on the +15% from Empowering Auras. Pretty sure it’s 1 of only 2 Traits that have a damage down modifier (the other is a Thief one which gives Pistols piercing at a damage reduction cost. It is also competing with an actual damage up Trait too). The other Boons range from nice to have (Might & Vigor) to useful in certain situations (Aegis).

Elemental Epitome
Gain an Aura based on current Attunement when you combo. Gain Elemental Empowerment whenever you gain an Aura. 10s ICD per Attunement.
Fire: Fire Aura | Water: Frost Aura | Air: Shocking Aura | Earth: Magnetic Aura

The Trait that allows you to keep generating stacks quickly. Since the ICD is per Attunement, you’re able to gain stacks constantly and then loop back again, playing into the flow aspect that’s encouraged with Hammer 3. Also niche interactions with Aura skills from other weapons / some Leap combos. Makes combos more useful than a small debuff thrown out randomly, etc.

Staunch Auras
Gain Stability when granting self an Aura.

The Aura or “Defensive” option. Quotation marks since it doesn’t directly stop you from dying, only CC’d. Can’t add Protection since there’s an Earth trait for it. Resolution is free but it’s somewhat specific to DoT damage which isn’t as common as direct damage. Possibly a Barrier as well as Stability for survivability. 

Empowered Empowerment
While at max stacks of Elemental Empowerment (10), double its effectiveness (+10% -> +20% All Stats).

The Buff or technically Offensive option. Effect itself is pretty boring, but rewarding maintaining 10 stacks adds more weight on the stacks. Put “technically Offensive” option there since a pure support / healing Catalyst doesn’t work & if you’re going Support DPS, you’ll want the below option anyway, leaving this as the “offensive” option.

Sphere Specialist
Boons applied from your Jade Sphere have 2x the duration (applied before Boon Duration).

The Sphere or Support option. It’s also pretty boring, but it makes you need less Boon Duration to be able to keep Boons up which means you get to spend more of your gear stats on offensive ones (or defensive for whatever reason).

Guardian
Guardian Combat
Like the archetype; it’s basically Paladin without the religion.
Standard 2 weapon skill bars, swapping in combat has a cooldown.
Profession Mechanics are Virtues, passives that can be sacrificed for a more powerful active.
Virtue of Justice: Burn every few attacks. Activate to make the next attack for you & allies Burn.
Virtue of Resolve: passively heal self. Activate to cleanse self and PBAoE heal.
Virtue of Courage: gain Aegis, refreshing every 40s. Activate to grant PBAoE Aegis.
Lowest HP in the game (tied with Elementalist & Thief) but highest base armour (tied with Warrior & Revenant). Also has a decent amount of active defensive skills, focusing on proactive tankiness rather than face tanking.
Low HP isn’t as big of a problem on Guardian compared to Ele but the difference still feels bad (11k vs 19k between lowest & highest).
It’s especially annoying on higher ping where you have less time to react.
Base Guardian focuses more on defensive / protective skills for self & allies, fitting with the theme & name really.
Guardian skills have a lot of light fields which generally result in cleansing effects. These are presented in the form of Symbols which are pulsing ground AoEs that benefit allies and hinder enemies.
Also has access to Wards which prevent enemies from passing over them.
Guardian Abilities
Greatsword
High damage & slow attacks w/ cleave.

Strike -> Vengeful Strike -> Wrathful Strike
Frontal cleave.
Frontal cleave, more damage.
Frontal cleave, most damage & grant PBAoE Might per enemy hit.

Pretty simple auto chain for a melee weapon. Little bit of Might but it only lasts 5s so it can’t really be used to properly maintain / add stacks. It does have the same range as a 1H sword though, I think it’d make more sense if it was slightly longer ranged given the size difference between the weapons generally.

Whirling Wrath
Combo Whirl for PBAoE ticking damage. Also sends out projectiles that damage.

Optimal use is to use the skill while inside the enemy hitbox which is a no no in by book. Only way to fix this is to either get rid of the projectiles (which I assume were added to make it a more unique greatsword spin attack) or make them home in on the targeted enemy rather than fire out randomly. Another option is to split the damage so the majority of it is on the whirling blade, right now it’s 50/50. Combo Whirl makes sense, even if it’s slower than Ele’s Hammer Air 2 which doesn’t have it.

Leap of Faith
Combo Leap for PBAoE damage & Blind + healing for each enemy hit.

Gap closer which can be used can be used for damage, survivability (heal + Blind) or mobility. There’s some drawback if you use it for damage and end up needing the gap closer while it’s recharging, etc. Other than that it’s your usual gap closer with extra utility.

Symbol of Resolution
PBAoE Light Combo field, damaging enemies & pulsing Resolution for allies.

PBAoE damage & Resolution. If the Resolution buff seems out of place it’s because it used to be called Symbol of Wrath and gave Retaliation (thorns). Otherwise it’s just more melee damage that interacts with some Traits for more damage. Cleansing utility from Light field is also there.

Binding Blade -> Pull
Combo Whirl & send out projectiles to nearby enemies that damage & apply a unique DoT. Allows the use of Pull if at least 1 target is hit, surprisingly pulling enemies in and consuming the DoT damage.

Optimal single target damage use is to also use it while inside the enemy hitbox + have other enemies around. Fortunately most of the damage is via the DoT so it’s less reliant on the initial hit hitting multiple times and the Dot doesn’t stack with itself so there’s no multitarget shenanigans. DoT being consumed means you’ll have to time the CC or sacrifice the damage for the CC, which is more prevalent in PvE since the window for good use of CC is less than compared to PvP. Also acts as a Combo Whirl, which makes me realise that Ele weapons just suck in that department, having 1 or 2 Combo related skills while Guardian gets all 4. Yes there are 4 Attunements but cycling just for a combo isn’t generally worth it.

Hammer
Melee w/ focus on AoE & control. 



Hammer Swing -> Hammer Bash -> Symbol of Protection
Frontal cleave.
Frontal cleave, same damage.
AoE Light Combo field between self & target, damaging enemies & pulsing Protection for allies.

The 2nd attack could use an extra effect or slightly more damage, just to make it differentiate from the 1st and feel like the combo is getting stronger. The whole combo takes 2.4s and the field lasts a base 2s, meaning it’s possible to get 100% uptime if Quickness is applied making it a strong defensive weapon option. It’s the only Symbol that can do that due to not technically having a cooldown, but requires constant auto attacking. The field does get placed in front of you so that might cause issues sometimes depending on the hitbox of the enemy.

Mighty Blow
Leap (not combo) forward & PBAoE damage & Blast combos. Teleport to an enemy if they have the Mighty Blow debuff.

AoE Damage & Blast. There’s a small leap but it doesn’t count as a Combo Leap for some reason, probably because the technology for 2 Combo using components on a single skill. Can sort of be used as a gap closer, though the leap is short and the Banish teleport requires you hitting it w/ a melee skill.

Zealot’s Embrace
Fire a projectile that damages & Immobilizes enemies. Gain Barrier for each enemy hit, Barrier amount frontloaded on 1st target.

Some CC & survivability to help a melee catch up & live respectively. Doesn’t count as a Projectile for combo purposes.

Banish
Single target damage & Knockback. Applies a debuff which will cause Mighty Blow to blink to the target.

Normally I’d say something about it being single target but due to the teleport mechanic w/ Mighty Blow, I’d have to agree w/ it being single target otherwise it might break something when it tries to teleport to multiple debuffed targets. It’s actually the hardest hitting Hammer ability so in PvE, there’s a choice between saving it for CC or using it for damage (only 15s CD so not too bad of a choice).

Ring of Warding
Places a Light Combo field ring that knocks back enemies that try to cross it.

Very easy to cancel with movement input; should also only be cancellable with dodges, sheathing or pressing Esc (and obviously being CC’d or downed). It’s purely a PvP skill though as mobs don’t try to escape and it’s a small circle. If it also provided some survivability for allies, this could be a useful skill but as of right now it’s at best just a combo field that can sometimes CC enemies if they try moving.
