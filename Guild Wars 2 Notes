Guild Wars 2 Notes
General
Good combat, mixture of action and tab targeting.
No trinity, but the most efficient way to play for endgame stuff is with pseudo trinity anyway (tank / kiter, healer, DPS, support = buff & healer / DPS hybrid).
Quickness + Alacrity buffs shape the meta. Do not like these buffs as it feels awful not to have them, whereas no Might (+Damage) or Fury (+Crit chance) don’t feel nearly as bad when you don’t have them.
Wiki integration is great, and would be perfect if there was an in-game client rather than having to open it in a browser.
Again, spoilt by FFXIV with having all classes on 1 character, really miss that since I end up creating either 1 character but cloning it for other classes (GW2), using almost default presets for the non main classes (BDO) or just not having more than 1 class (WoW).
