Game Feeling & 8 Kinds of Fun
Game Feeling
Games evoke emotions & feelings.
Constructing a game to evoke specific emotions can lead to the greatest, most cohesive experience.
Same game experience can lead to different feelings for different audiences.
Mastery, challenge, excitement / frustration are common.
Understand what emotion your game is trying to evoke; make sure every component of the game is trying to get the emotional response you want, otherwise cut it.

8 Kinds of Fun
Sensation: touch (collecting objects), auditory (music / audio feedback) & visual (rewards / victory screens).
Fellowship: teamwork (party games, raids, etc).
Challenge: game mastery, usually PvP or high end raids.
Fantasy: role-playing in an immersive setting.
Narrative: story, usually w/ sensation + fantasy.
Discovery: exploration, open world.
Expression: creativity in both design + character builds.
Submission: relaxation & minimal effort, combined with sensation (sim games).

Specific kinds of fun produce different game feelings; different kinds of fun appeal to different players.
Categorizing fun: different kinds lend themselves to different kinds of design choices (for mechanics, depth of strategy, complexity).
Targeting the right ones results in a more cohesive & immersive game feeling (challenge vs. fellowship or challenge + fellowship).
Games have different sets of player audiences, catering for the different audiences within a game can create the strongest offering.
Players are unique & find fun from different sources. Types of fun are a tool to service the greater game feeling.
Frustration can come from Challenge or Fellowship w/ players that have different motivations to you. Challenges need to remain hard, but not unfair.
