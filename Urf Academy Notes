Game Feeling & 8 Kinds of Fun
Game Feeling
Games evoke emotions & feelings.
Constructing a game to evoke specific emotions can lead to the greatest, most cohesive experience.
Same game experience can lead to different feelings for different audiences.
Mastery, challenge, excitement / frustration are common.
Understand what emotion your game is trying to evoke; make sure every component of the game is trying to get the emotional response you want, otherwise cut it.

8 Kinds of Fun
Sensation: touch (collecting objects), auditory (music / audio feedback) & visual (rewards / victory screens).
Fellowship: teamwork (party games, raids, etc).
Challenge: game mastery, usually PvP or high end raids.
Fantasy: role-playing in an immersive setting.
Narrative: story, usually w/ sensation + fantasy.
Discovery: exploration, open world.
Expression: creativity in both design + character builds.
Submission: relaxation & minimal effort, combined with sensation (sim games).

Specific kinds of fun produce different game feelings; different kinds of fun appeal to different players.
Categorising fun: different kinds lend themselves to different kinds of design choices (for mechanics, depth of strategy, complexity).
Targeting the right ones results in a more cohesive & immersive game feeling (challenge vs. fellowship or challenge + fellowship).
Games have different sets of player audiences, catering for the different audiences within a game can create the strongest offering.
Players are unique & find fun from different sources. Types of fun are a tool to service the greater game feeling.
Frustration can come from Challenge or Fellowship w/ players that have different motivations to you. Challenges need to remain hard, but not unfair.


Goals & Pacing
Pacing via clear goals & subgoals throughout to provide peaks & troughs of engagement.
Mix of short-term & long-term: moment-to-moment, game-to-game, session-to-session, month-to-month, etc.
Some players are intrinsically motivated, others aren’t. Providing extrinsic motivation (meta-game progression) can achieve long term engagement.
Align player’s goal w/ an appropriated reward. Good goals allow players to recognize them immediately (I’m meant to explore area A) while bad goals produce undesirable behaviour (anti-patterns) / not being sure what to do next.
Anti-patterns: analysis paralysis (too many choices for player to make a decision), unclear optimisation, fun failing to exceed anti-fun (especially for other players), false choices, expectation breaking, etc.

Clear & intuitive goals let players reason about what they’re trying to achieve at a given moment & gives meaning to their actions.
Good goal & subgoal structure gives a game pacing & rhythm that prevents a player from being bored or overwhelmed.
Good goals create gameplay & are clear & intuitive, while bad goals create undesirable behaviour.
Subgoals are the smaller objectives within the game experience.
Tensions should generally rise as multiple players approach the final goal.
Lacking subgoals makes it difficult for players to understand their progression (winning or losing, at the beginning, middle or end).
Subgoals allow for ebbs and flows of intensity, allowing gauging of progression on a smaller & more appreciable time scale.
Good goals produce game stats that are dynamic & create interaction (gameplay) between players.
Good gameplay occurs when players are able to change their decisions based on the game state.
Bad goals are meaningless, frustrating for everyone or lack gameplay / meaningful decisions. Unclear, leading to low satisfaction. Also has unclear optimisations & promotes poor gameplay.

Interesting turn (good decision making) is when a player’s decision has an impact on another player’s decision or their future turns.
Innovation: uniqueness. Would it delight a player?
Depth (Gameplay): have good gameplay? Promote strong decision making + w/ respect to other players?
Complexity: simple goal + have gameplay depth (many situations can arise)? Simple + deep = good.
Cohesion: does well w/ thematic, narrative, type of fun + mechanics work together?
Satisfaction: goal is fun?

Good goals create gameplay & are clear & intuitive, while bad goals create undesirable behaviour.
Frameworks: is the complexity of this design worth the depth? Is the increase in fun for one type of player worth the reduction in fun for another type of player?
