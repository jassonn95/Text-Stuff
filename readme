This is just a place for me to backup text documents like breakdowns I've done on games.

The below will describe why on certain days there aren't any changes in activity. Please note that any missing days excluding the below are weekends and public holidays.

15/5/23: Computer's PSU died, spent all day troubleshooting so obviously unable to continue with game design analysis. Hoping to be fixed by tomorrow.

16/6/23: Took a day off as I had finally finished the GW2 break down after a month or so.

20/6/23 - 23/6/23: Took the week off as I was sick.

26/6/23 - 30/6/23: Took the week of as it was my birthday week and I felt I could use the rest after 4 months straight working on game design related projects.

10/7/23: Preparing an update on LinkedIn, including profile picture and the actual relevant parts.

11/7/23: Further refinement of changes to be added to LinkedIn profile.

12/7/23: Workshopping with ChatGPT regarding game design career options.

13/7/23: Updated LinkedIn profile: profile picture, background picture, headline, websites, summary / about section, current experience + details for the IT jobs + recent game development, education & skills. This really should be 8+ different commits but whatever.

14/7/23: Refined LinkedIn sections.

17/7/23: Further refinement of LinkedIn profile. Went over Udemy course for getting a game design job briefly (will do more later).

18/7/23: Searched for opportunities in Sydney; there aren't many.

19/7/23: Going through FFXIV Patch 6.45.

20/7/23: Continued going through FFXIV Patch 6.45 + BG3.

21/7/23: Checked out League's new Arena mode and event.

24/7/23: Checked out GW2's Festival of the Four Winds event.

25/7/23: Checking out some relevant job postings and filtering them.

26/7/23: Checking out Ubisoft job listing.

27/7/23: Researching MMORPG trends over the year so far.

28/7/23: Preparing steps to tailor profile, application, resume etc to Ubisoft job. Eventually found out it was reposted again but then no longer accepting applications. Will hold out for a while.

31/7/23 - Updated Seek profile to match LinkedIn profile. Generated resumes using the in-built resume generators for both websites. Replied to LinkedIn messages. Building connections on LinkedIn.

1/8/23 - Brainstorming w/ chat AIs for new things and added them to a to do list:
GCAP + PAX: Keep an eye on it and get tickets. Most likely not the Sunday one for PAX (Oct 2 - 7 in Melb).
Udemy: Go over "How To Get a Job in the Video Game Industry" course again and apply it to what you've done the past several months.
Portfolio Website: Wix / Squarespace, with the latter being higher quality at slightly higher cost. Remember to think of a domain.
Networking: LinkedIn. Possibly chat with Rioters. Add the Rick guy from Udemy. Games cons in 1st point in Oct.
Modding: More DoS2 mods, possibly BG3 if it's readily available.
Game James: Maybe, prefer to focus on mods.
Analysis: possibly on more MMOs or on games recently played.
Discord: specific game dev ones.

2/8/23 - Keeping an eye on PAX. Began going over Udemy course notes. Conversations on LinkedIn regarding possible opportunities.

3/8/23 - Couple of phone interviews. Began going over both Udemy course notes and LinkedIn profile to further improve. Did a bunch of reading on Riot on the career / employee side of things + scouting people out on LinkedIn.

7/8/23 - Forgot to add last week, but BG3 day! I have no idea what I'm doing.

8/8/23 - More BG3. Honestly that might be the entire week, plus minor things on LinkedIn. We'll see.

9/8/23 - Surprise, surprise. Even more BG3. I slightly know what I'm doing now. Also adjusted the dates on some of the previous entries, accidentally set it to the weekend (which was BG3 but irrelevant to the "job hunt").
