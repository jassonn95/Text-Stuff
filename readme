This is just a place for me to backup text documents like breakdowns I've done on games.

The below will describe why on certain days there aren't any changes in activity. Please note that any missing days excluding the below are weekends and public holidays.

15/5/23: Computer's PSU died, spent all day troubleshooting so obviously unable to continue with game design analysis. Hoping to be fixed by tomorrow.

16/6/23: Took a day off as I had finally finished the GW2 break down after a month or so.

20/6/23 - 23/6/23: Took the week off as I was sick.

26/6/23 - 30/6/23: Took the week of as it was my birthday week and I felt I could use the rest after 4 months straight working on game design related projects.

10/7/23: Preparing an update on LinkedIn, including profile picture and the actual relevant parts.

11/7/23: Further refinement of changes to be added to LinkedIn profile.
