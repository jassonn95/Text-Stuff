Black Desert Notes
General
Great combat.
Looks pretty.
Story was… there.
Leveling is auto-walking to the next quest, killing a bunch of stuff or interacting with a couple things and then repeating.
Then it becomes a grindfest. Not much to do other than grinding, whether it be combat or life skill stuff.
Recall leaving my computer online with auto-walk on to level up stamina for like an extra 50 or something. Didn’t do it last time I played (2021) so might’ve been removed?
Also recall auto-leveling by afking at a dummy and paying to auto hit it (have to leave the computer on, sure this isn’t a crypto miner?).
Storage wasn’t shared, required going to each storage to access (NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK).
Good horses required taming & breeding or spending a crap ton of money.
Titular desert itself feels desert-y (large, easy to get lost) but other than that it wasn’t really interesting.
Dislike genderlocking classes (and eventually racelocking). Worst offender was Witch / Wizard, remember playing years ago and Witch was a very young woman and Wizard was Gandalf only (younger face + body added).
Economy seems over the top (common stuff costing millions, billions for end game stuff). Makes starting out feel kinda bad since stuff is like 1k compared to the m/billions.
Enhancing gear has a chance of both failing and blowing up your gear, absolutely hate.
Spoilt by FFXIV with having all classes on 1 character, really miss that since I end up creating either 1 character but cloning it for other classes (GW2), using almost default presets for the non main classes (BDO) or just not having more than 1 class (WoW).
