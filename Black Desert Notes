Black Desert Notes
General
Good combat; feels satisfying to combo AoE mob packs down.
Looks pretty.
Story was… there?
Leveling is auto-walking to the next quest, killing a bunch of stuff or interacting with a couple things and then repeating.
Then it becomes a grindfest. Not much to do other than grinding, whether it be combat or life skill stuff.
Recall leaving my computer online with auto-walk on to level up stamina for like an extra 50 or something. Didn’t do it last time I played (2021) so might’ve been removed?
Also recall auto-leveling by afking at a dummy and paying to auto hit it (have to leave the computer on, sure this isn’t a crypto miner?).
Storage wasn’t shared between each town for example, requiring going to each storage to access.
Good horses required taming & breeding or spending a crap ton of money.
Titular desert itself feels desert-y (large, easy to get lost) but other than that it wasn’t really interesting.
Dislike genderlocking classes (and eventually racelocking). Worst offender was Witch / Wizard, remember playing years ago and Witch was a very young woman and Wizard was Gandalf only (younger face + body added).
Economy seems over the top (common stuff costing millions, billions for end game stuff). Makes starting out feel kinda bad since stuff is like 1k compared to the m/billions.
Enhancing gear has a chance of both failing and blowing up your gear, absolutely hate.
Spoilt by FFXIV with having all classes on 1 character, really miss that since I end up creating either 1 character but cloning it for other classes (GW2), using almost default presets for the non main classes (BDO) or just not having more than 1 class (WoW).
Tooltips are detailed yet also vague (what’s the difference between “increase casting speed” and “increase activation speed”? Not mentioned anywhere).
Backpedal = Forward Guard.

Sage Combat

Feels satisfying to combo AoE mob packs down.
Never really ran out of mana for anything, resource management doesn’t seem like it’s a thing unless I’m spamming blinks (regarding stamina).
Blinking to a pack, using a small combo and then blinking to another felt smooth.
Being able to relocate AoEs with the blink during casting animations gives more freedom and makes the combat feel like it flows.

Sage Succession Abilities


Kyve Mastery

Melee filler auto-attack chain.
Recovers mana per hit.

Just filler, not much else to be said about this. Damage is back loaded so somewhat punished if interrupted. Never really used the sprint / jump versions (jumping is kind of janky in this game).

Ator’s Fist

Cone nuke.
-DP on hit for enemy.
Knockdown.

Similar to Sett W. 

Spatial Fissure

Frontal AoE.
Recovers mana per hit.
Increased accuracy for 10s.
Knockdown.

Gravity Rift

Frontal AoE.
Heal per hit.
Sucks in then knocks down.
Forward Guard (block damage and CC from front up to a certain amount).

Void Gateways

Wide, slow frontal AoE.
Guaranteed crit.
Knocks up.
Forward Guard.



Ator’s Mark

Frontal circular AoE.
Somewhat slow.
Guaranteed crit.
-Evasion on hit for enemy.
Bound on hit (knockdown seems to last longer but you can manually get up after 2s).
Forward Guard.

Can be empowered by Black Spirit, making it stronger at the cost of rage.

Animation can be skipped by using any skill then following up with this one.

Illusion Compression

Large frontal circle AoE (hits around you too).
Sucks in, staggers then knocks up.

Has to be placed in a Quick Slot after learning Dimensional Compression (see below).

Form Shift & Form Recall

Forward damaging dash.
Super Armor (immune to all CC except for grab / grapple).
Knocks down.
Ghosting.

Can be chained w/ Form Recall below which is the same thing except returns to original location.

Illusion Expansion & Illusion Detonation

Wide & short frontal AoE.
+AP on skill use.
Stagger on hit.

Can be comboed into Illusion Detonation for a finisher for more damage and a knockdown.

Spatial Collapse & Finishing Touch

Large frontal AoE.
Somewhat slow.
Guaranteed crit.
-DP on hit for enemy.
Bound on hit.
Forward Guard.

Can be comboed w/ Finishing Touch for more damage and also knocks up.

Somewhat long animation.
Guaranteed crit.
Forward Guard.
Knockdown on hit.

Can be comboed into Atomagia for:
Even longer animation.

Crit Damage.
Super Armor.

Spear Bolt

Ranged attack into optional gap closer.
Guaranteed crit.
+AP after using skill.
Forward Guard.
Invincible (immune to everything) while dashing (more of a blink).

Rift Storm

PBAoE
Guaranteed crit.
Super Armor.

Illusion Barrier

Channeled frontal block, using Forward Guard (so will be broken after X damage).

+DP at start of channel (no refresh).

Big mana recovery on block.

Reset

Cooldown that resets all Sage specific cooldowns.
Super Armor.

Rift Chain

Dash
Cooldown is for the effect:
Invincible when not on cooldown.
Super Armor when on cooldown (so immune to most CC but still take damage).
+DP on use.
Ghosting throughout the whole dash, up until the end.

Ator’s Thorn

Ranged attack.
Slow.
Uses stamina for some reason.

Weaker than most attacks and a bunch of them have CC attached to them already, don’t really see any point in this skill.

Realm of Anguish

Places circular AoE in front.
Damaging field.
-Magic DP on hit for enemy.
Forward Guard when casting.
Bound on hit.

Ator’s Illusion vs. Ator’s Palm

Forward AoE nuke.
Fast animation.
Stuns.
The “sidestep” is very small, don’t think it actually dodges anything. Doesn’t block so not really a counter either.

Vs.

Larger AoE.
Health recovery on hit.
-DP debuff.
CC only in PvE
Longer animation.

Palm has a much larger AoE but has a long casting time so it’s riskier, especially in PvP where it doesn’t even have CC attached. Fast abilities in general feel better.

Energized Thorn vs. Piercing Thorn

Large circular AoE at a ranged location.
Forward Guard.

Vs.

Long but narrow AoE.
CC.

Energized has a larger AoE and has protection but no CC. Generally I only did PvE so I went with the first, but even so Piercing is unprotected and getting caught w/ 200 ping is very likely.

Void Eruption vs. Void Blast

Forward AoE nuke.
Guaranteed crit.
Super Armor.
Recover mana per hit.

Vs.

Forward AoE nuke.
Pulls in (PVE only).
Forward Guard.
HP recovery per hit.

Pretty similar nukes but Eruption has animation canceling which makes it feel smoother.
