New World Notes
General
Enjoyed the fact that any weapon can be levelled on any character. Since there are no classes, weapons are the replacement so technically any character can “multi-class”, no need for rolling alts.
Looks pretty.
Didn’t follow the story at all, mostly just frontier stuff and fighting different shades of zombie (on release).
As mentioned, mobs were very similar. Most were zombies with different colour palettes. 
Audio feedback with levelling / gaining exp was really good, particularly noticeable when gathering.
Storage originally was only accessible at that place, so if you wanted to get something you had to go there manually. This has since been changed to be connected.
Travelling progressively got worse the deeper I got into the game. Maps got larger but still had to walk everywhere; no mounts.
Fast travelling costs currency, cost increasing with weight + distance. It’s also used for respeccing and crafting stat bonuses while also being capped at just 1k. It encourages you to use it because of the cap but you’re also discouraged to use it because of its other uses & the cost increases. Costs have since been decreased but the original issue made playing & exploring feel bad.
Feels like it doesn’t respect your time with the slow manual travelling and no proper alternative that feels worth it.
This has been alleviated a little bit with the storage being accessible from anywhere, but you still need to slowly go back to towns.
Cool that housing is instanced, but never got up to that point myself.
Originally there was only 1 “Focus” weapon (for healers) so it felt pretty bad levelling since you always had 1 suboptimal weapon. Void gauntlet has since been added.
Questing was the usual go to hub, collect quests, go out and collect bear arses and then come back. This includes the main story and the repeatable town ones.
Combat.
Originally getting into dungeons, the only instanced group content at the time, required a tedious process of getting a key / attunement. This is no longer required and you can finally do MMO stuff in an MMO.
Originally, the starting zone was completely random and my friend and I were split up and had to meet up after doing the tutorial. Considering this is an MMO, it shouldn’t be splitting people up like that and should’ve had an option to start together (it took a good 10 minutes of travelling for me to reach my friend).
