New World Notes
General
Enjoyed the fact that any weapon can be levelled on any character. Since there are no classes, weapons are the replacement so technically any character can “multi-class”, no need for rolling alts.
Looks pretty.
Didn’t follow the story at all, mostly just frontier stuff and fighting different shades of zombie (on release).
Combat has the main features of an action MMO (stamina dodging, camera aiming vs. tab targeting) but it also has long animation locks which ruin the combat flow. Nothing about it makes it stand out from the others enough to ignore the drawbacks.
As mentioned, mobs were very similar. Most were zombies with different colour palettes. Apparently it’s been spruced up.
Audio feedback with levelling / gaining exp was really good, particularly noticeable when gathering.
Storage originally was only accessible at that place, so if you wanted to get something you had to go there manually. This has since been changed to be connected.
Travelling progressively got worse the deeper I got into the game. Maps got larger but still had to walk everywhere; no mounts.
Fast travelling costs currency, cost increasing with weight + distance. It’s also used for respeccing and crafting stat bonuses while also being capped at just 1k. It encourages you to use it because of the cap but you’re also discouraged to use it because of its other uses & the cost increases. Costs have since been decreased but the original issue made playing & exploring feel bad.
Feels like it doesn’t respect your time with the slow manual travelling and no proper alternative that feels worth it.
This has been alleviated a little bit with the storage being accessible from anywhere, but you still need to slowly go back to towns.
Cool that housing is instanced, but never got up to that point myself.
Originally there was only 1 “Focus” weapon (for healers) so it felt pretty bad levelling since you always had 1 suboptimal weapon. Void gauntlet has since been added.
Questing was the usual go to hub, collect quests, go out and collect bear arses and then come back. This includes the main story and the repeatable town ones.
Originally getting into dungeons, the only instanced group content at the time, required a tedious process of getting a key / attunement. This is no longer required and you can finally do MMO stuff in an MMO.
Originally, the starting zone was completely random and my friend and I were split up and had to meet up after doing the tutorial. Considering this is an MMO, it shouldn’t be splitting people up like that and should’ve had an option to start together (it took a good 10 minutes of travelling for me to reach my friend).
No mini-map, only has the Elder Scrolls compass at the top.
Gearsets were not available on release, but you get 2 for free now and if you want more, it’s microtransaction time!
There’s flag-based open world PvP which I didn’t get into since I prefer structured PvP and the animations for spells made me feel like I’d be at a disadvantage anyway.

Fire Staff Combat
Auto-attacks are the weakest, dinkiest sounding blobs ever.
Many of the spell effects are lacklustre.
Meteor Shower actually killed the weapon for me with how unsatisfying it was; I straight up swapped to Life Staff because of it.
Many animation locks or movement speed locks, makes it feel bad to use abilities.

Abilities and their related passives will be highlighted red together.
Skills will be listed in roughly top to bottom order of the skill tree:



1 point needs to be spent in a row to access the next one.
10 total points need to be spent in a tree to access the bottom skill.
Both skill trees share skill points (20 total).

Fire Staff Abilities
Fire Mage


Pillar of Fire
Ground targeted circle AoE.
Locked into casting walk speed for a couple of seconds after casting animation finishes.

Simple AoE ability. The movespeed lock it puts you into after casting makes it feel bad to use, goes against the action-y nature of the game. Mana costs are negligible unless you’re spamming heals so there’s no management there.

Strike The Match

Encourages management of a debuff which adds an extra layer to the combat. Not sure if this works with other people’s debuffs. Effect itself is just more damage, nothing too exciting but everyone likes bigger numbers.

Arson’s Advantage

Since mana isn’t an issue at all in this game, this passive is almost entirely useless. It’s effect is also very feast / famine in the sense that it’s overkill in AoE situations and (if mana were an issue) not worth spending an entire point on in single target situations.

Spell Focus

Heavy attacks are actually less DPS than light attack spam. It’s effectively only used to break blocks so there wouldn’t be much use out of this ability. Again, opportunity cost and mana isn’t an issue anyway. Could easily be in-built like ESO.

Fiery Restoration

This is a much better choice (not actually a choice between the 2, but limited points = opportunity cost) for heavy attack augmentation as it allows you to cast the “good” abilities more often.

Meteor Shower
Ground targeted AoE with cast time.
Dinkiest sound effects known to man.
Zero (0) impactful hits, visual or audio.
Spell effects and sounds end abruptly.
Also locked into casting walk speed.

It was so bad it turned me off of the weapon completely. It’s called Meteor Shower and what we got were a couple of pellets. AoE is far too small and everything about it is not impactful enough to want to use it, list above.That being said I do like it does damage in pulses, not projectiles like GW2 / old GP ult, RNG would’ve made it 100x worse.

Immolation

Like other mana related skills, it’s not that impactful since mana management isn’t really a thing. That being said, the red highlighted skills are linked so you need to access the first 2 to get access to the 3rd one (need to select this if you want Judgement of Helios for example).

Judgement of Helios

Like other smolder skills, it encourages management of debuff which adds another layer to the combat. That being said, this requires the previous skill to be taken AND requires you to use Meteor Shower (did I mention I don’t like that skill?).

Fiery Determination

Only really useful for PvP, in PvE you won’t get much use out of it if you position yourself correctly / have a tank. I do like that it explains what grit is in the tooltip.

Clear Mind

Encourages staying above 50% mana for more damage, it adds something else to manage. As mentioned before, mana isn’t really an issue so while the concept is decent, there isn’t much issue in maintaining it.

Singe

Makes auto-attacks less crappy and helps apply the debuff for other related skills (don’t think it refreshes duration). Other than that, it’s not really that exciting as this impacts auto-attacks mostly and they don’t feel that great to use.

Fireball
Targeted lob of fire.
Does not feel like a fireball at all, more like a blob of jelly. No oomph.

Pretty disappointing compared to other fireballs from other games; there’s no impactful explosion. Other than that it’s pretty stock standard but most of the fun from this type of skill is the explosion.

Scorched Earth
+smolder

Again, it helps with applying the debuff. That being said, it’s starting to feel like these should be basekit so skill points could be freed up for something more interesting. Right now it’s a “if you’re using fireball, take it” kind of situation.

Catch

Direct hit requirement encourages good aim and while the mana isn’t that helpful, the cooldown reduction means abilities are used more often and they’re the interesting parts of the combat.

Spellslinger

Pretty boring but this falls in line with the +damage sentiment so it at least sometimes feels good.

Clear Casting

Much more interesting than the last skill as it rewards good positioning / dodging w/ damage.

Prophet of a Fire God

Same as Spellslinger, but for crit damage rather than crit chance.

Flare

Interesting option as it changes an attack to be AoE. Drawback doesn’t really matter in PvE as enemies are less likely to dodge.

Runes of Helios

Leylines / Rune of Power, can’t go wrong with it. Encourages you to stay in the circle which adds a layer of risk vs. reward. Interesting way to implement it as it’s attached to any fire staff ability rather than having a dedicated skill itself, saves on button bloat but also makes it a little clunky (requires a CD, some edge cases where you want it for your 2nd weapon for example).

Pyromancer


Flamethrower
Channelled frontal AoE.
Movement speed slowed while casting.
NOT locked into casting walk speed after spell ends.

Feels exactly like a flamethrower does w/ the slowed movement speed. Interestingly NOT locked to the speed after casting ends like other skills for some reason. Makes it a little risky to use due to being short ranged and channelled but does DPS & apply debuff so risk vs. reward.

Fire’s Reach

Does exactly what it says. Not super impactful as it’s still ranged and the increase isn’t big enough for it to become a fully fledged ranged ability; mileage will vary with danger zone range cutoffs from enemy attacks, etc. Again, required for the below skills.

Infernal Flames

Damage increase, nothing more.

Pyro Dancer

Impact of cooldown related skills exponentially increases the higher it gets, and what’s higher than 100%? Changes the priority of skills and places this on top and also increases the importance of mana management.

Pyromania

Damage increase that’s slightly more involved. Not sure if it’s affected by other player debuffs or even what a “burn” is as that’s not mentioned in any of the fire staff skills.

Incinerate
PBAoE after a short cast animation.
Locked into casting walk speed too after cast.

Shorter range than the flamethrower, it’s even riskier to use. The knockback and the grit makes me believe this is a PvP ability and with the way the game is set up with no split between PvE and PvP, it feels like this has no real use in PvE, other than in some whacky edge case of a fire staff tank with the taunt option. Never tested tanking myself so not sure if it places you at the top of the threat table (or if there even is a threat table) or if it’s just a 3s taunt and then they return to attacking others afterwards. Knockback would also be very annoying in instanced PvE.

Scorched

More smolder application, other abilities and passives do it better. Again, required for the below passives.

Cauterize Wounds

Some pocket healing but shouldn’t be needed if there’s a healer, more of a PvP thing again.

Flame Out

Damage increase but effectiveness increases in AoE situations. Can be used as an opener for the buff but other abilities just seem better overall.

Heat Up

Another way of applying the debuff, this time through dodging rather than damaging. Dodging is one of the key points of action combat but not going to happen that often in instanced PvE as you shouldn’t be tanking.

Let It Burn

Burnout
After a cast time, dash forward.
Locked into cast ending animation.
