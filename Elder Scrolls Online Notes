Elder Scrolls Online Notes

General
Combat is fine, basic Elder Scrolls affair. A bit repetitive after a while.
Story is good if you like Elder Scrolls.
There is a min-maxing of light attack weaving (left clicking between every ability). It’s really just a manual auto-attack, not sure if it really adds any challenge.
Crafting is time gated. Need to learn how to craft certain parts of gear and each time you learn a new piece it’s exponentially longer for the next time (I was up to a week for something).
Mount training (speed, stamina, storage) is also time gated daily.
Storage for crafting materials is membership only. Paying for convenience is a bit annoying since there’s so many random crafting mats.
Spoilt by FFXIV with having all classes on 1 character, really miss that since I end up creating either 1 character but cloning it for other classes (GW2), using almost default presets for the non main classes (BDO) or just not having more than 1 class (WoW).
