Elder Scrolls Online Notes
General
Combat is meh, basic Elder Scrolls affair. Even though it’s action combat it doesn’t feel that great, might be because of the ping.
Story is good if you like Elder Scrolls, otherwise not that interesting (only did base game).
There is a min-maxing of light attack weaving (left clicking between every ability). It’s really just a manual auto-attack, not sure if it really adds any challenge.
Crafting is time gated. Need to learn how to craft certain parts of gear and each time you learn a new piece it’s exponentially longer for the next time (I was up to a week).
Mount training (speed, stamina, storage) is also time gated daily.
Storage for crafting materials is membership only. Paying for convenience is a bit annoying since there’s so many random crafting mats. Could at least make it like GW2 and have a small amount of each material for free and then membership increases it.
Spoilt by FFXIV with having all classes on 1 character, really miss that since I end up creating either 1 character but cloning it for other classes (GW2), using almost default presets for the non main classes (BDO) or just not having more than 1 class (WoW).
There’s a shared levelling system once you reach max level between each character, but personally would’ve preferred to be able to do everything on 1 character like in FFXIV and Skyrim, its technical predecessor. Especially since I’m a bit of a completionist and want to clear the map. Holy moly there’s too many things on each map.
Weapon / armour skills are the same for all classes anyway so having all classes on 1 character should’ve been an option (where you can only change between classes in sanctuaries / outside of instances).
Awful loot boxes and FOMO cash shop, gross.
No mini-map, only Skyrim compass (without add-ons).
Nice that there’s add-on support but having to update is annoying, especially when I don’t know what I should be getting and just grabbing whatever is most downloaded. Would prefer official support / implementation.
Hate being forced to use a staff for magic builds when magic could be used with just the hands in Skyrim.
Recently there’s been a hybridisation of builds where you can mix and match magic and physical skills without impacting damage too much (it goes off of the max value of magicka + spell damage, magicka + weapon damage, stamina + SD or stamina + WD) for more build variety, at least on the casual level. Clever way of having a melee “magic” weapon without creating a new weapon set.
This document will be going through what I originally used though, which was destruction staff. If I were to play again, I’d go with a 2H sword + magicka build for a magic knight.
Races have passive racials and whilst the difference is small, it does add up so sometimes you feel like you’ve chosen the wrong race for your build.
Forced to go Breton since I wanted to play something human-ish but also use a magic build, which is fine since it’s what I did in Skyrim anyway.
Some skills require you to do PvP to unlock and level. Forcing people to do content they don’t want to / can’t do is a pretty bold move.
There are also skills locked behind story quests which isn’t as bad but still cumbersome.
Gear has set bonuses for extra damage / stats / playstyle changes (extra healing when solo, more damage but only 1 weapon set), won’t be listing them as there are a lot.
Skill points can be gained outside of levelling: builds are restricted to choosing your 12 active abilities + what morphs you want; you can practically take all passives (that apply).
