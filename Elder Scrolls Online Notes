Elder Scrolls Online Notes
General
Combat is fine, basic Elder Scrolls affair. Even though it’s action combat it doesn’t feel that great, might be because of the ping. Lots of putting down DoTs then spamming filler.
Story is good if you like Elder Scrolls, otherwise not that interesting (only did base game).
There is a min-maxing of light attack weaving (left clicking between every ability). It’s really just a manual auto-attack, not sure if it really adds any challenge.
Crafting is time gated. Need to learn how to craft certain parts of gear and each time you learn a new piece it’s exponentially longer for the next time (I was up to a week).
Mount training (speed, stamina, storage) is also time gated daily.
Storage for crafting materials is membership only. Paying for convenience is a bit annoying since there’s so many random crafting mats. Could at least make it like GW2 and have a small amount of each material for free and then membership increases it.
Spoilt by FFXIV with having all classes on 1 character, really miss that since I end up creating either 1 character but cloning it for other classes (GW2), using almost default presets for the non main classes (BDO) or just not having more than 1 class (WoW).
There’s a shared levelling system once you reach max level between each character, but would’ve preferred to be able to do everything on 1 character like in FFXIV or Skyrim. I’m a completionist and want to clear the map (there’s a LOT of stuff to clear on each map).
Weapon / armour skills are the same for all classes anyway so having all classes on 1 character should’ve been an option (where you can only change between classes in sanctuaries / outside of instances).
Awful loot boxes and FOMO cash shop, gross.
No mini-map, only Skyrim compass (without add-ons). Add-ons need to be up to date.
Nice that there’s add-on support but having to update is annoying, especially when I don’t know what I should be getting and just grabbing whatever is most downloaded. Would prefer official support / implementation.
Hate being forced to use a staff for magic builds vs. magic via hands in Skyrim.
Recently there’s been a hybridisation of builds where you can mix and match magic and physical skills without impacting damage too much (it goes off of the max value of magicka + spell damage, magicka + weapon damage, stamina + SD or stamina + WD) for more build variety, at least on the casual level. Clever way of having a melee “magic” weapon without creating a new weapon set.
Races have passive racials and whilst the difference is small, it does add up so sometimes you feel like you’ve chosen the wrong race for your build.
Forced to go Breton since I wanted to play something human-ish but also use a magic build, which is fine since it’s what I did in Skyrim anyway.
Some skills require you to do PvP to unlock and level. Forcing people to do content they don’t want to / can’t do is a pretty bold move.
There are also skills locked behind story quests which isn’t as bad.
Gear has set bonuses for extra damage / stats / playstyle changes (extra healing when solo, more damage but only 1 weapon set), won’t be listing them as there are a lot.
Skill points can be gained outside of levelling: builds are restricted to choosing your 12 active abilities + what morphs you want; you can practically take all passives (that apply).
Tooltips are detailed in that they provide cast times, targeting type, range / radius, duration, cost, damage / heal, etc.
Market boards are separate per town. I’m not travelling and checking each town market board, the heck.
Destruction Staff Combat
Light attack is this forward jab of the staff and a projectile flies out, looks a little dinky.
Fire & ice heavy attack charges a bunch of projectiles which home in on target. Lightning heavy attack is a back loaded channelled beam. All 3 recover magicka at the end, which is the primary use of heavy attacking.
As mentioned before, I don’t enjoy staves when it’s actively being used (a conduit or focus that sits on the back or in hand is fine).
Most abilities are AoE or DoTs with 1 spammable attack. This is the same for most weapons / class trees.
There are differences between fire, lice & lightning staves: Fire is single-target, ice is tanking & CC & lightning is AoE.
If you want a specific element, you’ll be locked into those specific effects which may or may not work for your build.
Generally didn’t use most of the abilities since they didn’t really fit with my class / aesthetic of a magic knight warrior thingy.
Destruction Staff Abilities

Elemental Storm (Ultimate)
Large ground targeted AoE field.

Morphs into:
More damage + more damage (fire), roots (ice) or +duration (lightning).
vs.
PBAoE that follows you.

Big AoE damaging field. Morphs are PvE vs. PvP since in PvE mobs usually run towards you / tank so it’s easier to keep them in the circle, whereas the 2nd morph will help more in PvP when chasing down.

Force Shock
Single target beam.

Morphs into:
Interrupts, sets Off Balance (heavy attack = +damage & knockdown + stun) and stuns.
vs.
Hits +2 targets if they have a status effect.

The spammable single-target ability for damage staff. 1st morph adds a little CC utility while the 2nd is pseudo AoE but requires prepping and is overall janky compared to an actual AoE ability.

Wall of Elements
Frontal ground AoE field.
Additional effect depending on what type of staff you have.

Morphs into:
Explodes on expiration, dealing damage.
vs.
Increases size & duration (+5s).

Damaging AoE field, different effects depending on the staff. Debuffs for the conditionals are either from a % chance from auto-attacks or guaranteed from specific, non-spammable options (ultimates or an ability with a DoT attached so spamming it is inefficient).

Morphs are a choice between damage or slight utility which wouldn’t be needed if aimed correctly. The 2nd option is overall less damage than the 1st, so it’s a non-choice.

Destructive Touch
Single target attack w/ DoT + burning, chilled or concussed.

Morphs into:
Removes DoT for knockback (fire), less damage but more range + CC (ice) or AoE (lightning).
vs.
Increased range (28m).

Guaranteed debuff but not spammable due to being backloaded. Morphs are utility or range. Didn’t really use this much as it’s a single target DoT and there are better ones + AoE ones vying for the limited ability slots.

Weakness to Elements
Single target resistance debuff.

Morphs into:
Burning, chilled or concussed every 7.5s + range.
vs.
Apply manasteal debuff for 1m, restoring magicka every second when damaging.

Single-target debuff. Morphs are either not useful (1st) or are better off on a support class in boss type situations (2nd). Not many situations where long lasting single-target debuffs were useful in the open world.

Impulse
PBAoE + effects depending on staff.

Morphs into:
Ground targeted AoE.
Or
Apply minor mangle debuff, reducing non-boss HP + triple chance of applying burning, chilled or concussed.

Spammable AoE. It’s PBAoE so there’s some risk involved. Fire & lightning have damage effects whereas frost has a tanking effect.

Morphs to be ranged or extra debuffs for mobs. Interesting to see morphs that change how the ability functions (1st). The 2nd morph is just a bunch of debuffs; some synergy with other abilities but again, I never really used staff abilities enthusiastically.

Tri Focus
Enhances staff heavy attacks.
Fire does more damage.
Lightning does AoE.
Ice gives self shield, scaling with HP. Also makes blocking w/ ice staff cost Magicka.

Passive reiterates the predetermined roles for each type of staff mentioned above: fire for single target, lightning for AoE and ice for tanking. Heavy attacking in general isn’t that effective compared to using a spammable > light attack > spammable so this passive just makes them less bad to use.

Penetrating Magic
Passive resistance penetration.

Elemental Force
Doubles status effect application. Note that there’s no information on what the base chance of applying via auto-attacks is.

Ancient Knowledge
Fire: more single target damage.
Lightning: more AoE damage.
Ice: easier tanking.

Same as the first passive above, enforcing the roles they were given.

Destruction Expert
Magicka recovery.

More magicka = more abilities = more player agency & fun.

Templar
Templar is pretty much the Paladin archetype from most games.
Aedric spear is the melee tree w/ manifestations of weapons and shields.
Dawn’s Wrath is the more magic based tree w/ fire & sun / light magic.
Restoring Light is the healing tree w/ light magic.
Overall it has a pretty coherent thematic, unlike Warden which has animals (that’s fine), nature magic (that’s fine) and ice (?).
That being said, using skills from other trees like weapons or guilds feels a bit off since they’re so thematically different. This is the same for all classes, to varying degrees.

Miscellaneous
Everything else that’s not as in depth since I didn’t play it long enough or only used 1 or 2 skills.
Two Handed
Auto-attacks feel much better than staff, but that’s only because I don’t like the staff animation of jabbing forward and having a projectile come out.
Heavy attack feels like it takes a very long time.
Only took the Critical Charge ability, which is a gapcloser w/ guaranteed crit and the morph which cleaves target and leaves a DoT field at the cost of more stamina.
Relevant passives are: cleave on autos, sword = +damage stat (axe + mace too but I only used sword), reduced cost for 2H abilities, heavy attack = +10% damage buff on next attack & +stamina recovery after killing a target. All relate to more damage or resource recovery = more abilities = more damage. All require 2H to be actively equipped.
Dual Wield
Took this for Templar because the spammable is melee ranged and the passives for Dual Wield apply while it’s the active weapon.
No abilities were taken since I was building a magicka build, so I don’t have a lot of stamina which is already reserved for Critical Charge above + dodging / blocking, etc.
Relevant passives are: +damage stat by % of off-hand, +damage stat for swords / +crit for daggers.
Wanted to try having 2 different types of weapons on each bar to level 2 skill trees up in case I ever wanted to use them in the future.
Light Armor
Light armour is for magicka builds (+healing).
Medium armour is for stamina builds.
Heavy armour is for tanking.
Light armour reduces magic damage taken, reduces stamina costs for dodging, sneaking, breaking free & bashing per light piece worn (applies to the below too).
Light armour increases physical damage taken, cost of blocking & damage by bash.
Slows are less effective & sprint cost is reduced.
Magicka recovery is increased & magicka cost is decreased.
Spell resistance, crit chance (both) and penetration (both) is increased.
Active ability Annulment (requires 5 / 7 light armour equipped) converts magicka into a shield (old active Seraph). Can morph to increase shield amount by # light armour worn or recover magicka whenever damage is absorbed (up to 3 times).
Went with light armour because I generally like magic based builds in games. Robes are ugly as heck so I covered them with outfits.
Others
Was recommended to add a couple of skills that either buff self or apply debuffs to enemies. However they didn’t really fit the general aesthetic I was going for (magic knight dude), recommended skills were bear traps or caltrops. Dawnbreaker is a better version of Radial Sweep, does the same thing but morphs to also increase weapon damage. Meteor is the same as Nova but morphs to gain ultimate for every enemy initially hit.
