Elder Scrolls Online Notes
General
Combat is meh, basic Elder Scrolls affair. Even though it’s action combat it doesn’t feel that great, might be because of the ping.
Story is good if you like Elder Scrolls, otherwise not that interesting really (only did original stuff up to max level).
There is a min-maxing of light attack weaving (left clicking between every ability). It’s really just a manual auto-attack, not sure if it really adds any challenge.
Crafting is time gated. Need to learn how to craft certain parts of gear and each time you learn a new piece it’s exponentially longer for the next time (I was up to a week for 1 research thing).
Mount training (speed, stamina, storage) is also time gated daily.
Storage for crafting materials is membership only. Paying for convenience is a bit annoying since there’s so many random crafting mats. Could at least make it like GW2 and have a small amount of each material for free and then membership increases it or something.
Spoilt by FFXIV with having all classes on 1 character, really miss that since I end up creating either 1 character but cloning it for other classes (GW2), using almost default presets for the non main classes (BDO) or just not having more than 1 class (WoW).
There’s a shared leveling system once you reach max level between each character, but personally would’ve preferred to be able to do everything on 1 character like in FFXIV and Skyrim, its technical predecessor. Especially since I’m a bit of a completionist and want to clear the map. Holy moly there’s too many things on each map.
Awful loot boxes and FOMO cash shop, gross.
No mini-map, only Skyrim compass (without add-ons).
Nice that there’s add-on support but having to update is annoying, especially when I don’t know what I should be getting and just grabbing whatever is most downloaded. Would prefer official support / implementation.
Hate being forced to use a staff for magic builds when magic could be used with just the hands in Skyrim.
